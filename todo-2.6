----- TODO --------------------------------------------------------------------
todo: Entries should look like this:

  Section.id ... description ... [id in the bug tracking sys if any]

            [fvwm worker(s) who want(s) to close the item]


A. Release stopping bugs
------------------------


B. Normal Bugs
--------------

  B.4 Fvwm doesn't seem to render what Unicode terms as "combining" or
      "composing" characters/marks/ligatures (eg. U+0308 or U+064E) correctly.
      Ref.: 2003-02-12  "Nadim Shaikli" Composing characters within fvwm

  B.5 The "titles" sometimes aren't shown when no items are available in a
      FvwmIconMan
      [Olivier: unable to reproduce this]

  B.7 strange xawtv fullscreen handling [#973,2002-12-23]. Not a bug? Dominik?
      [dv: if (contains_string("xawtv", report) { move_to_dev_null(report); }]


C. To be verified
-----------------

  C.2 StartOnScreen and Xinerama/SLS
      Ref.: 2002-12-22 "Andy Arbon" FVWM: Possible bug in StartsOnScreen

  C.3 Moving resizing certain applications with EWMH support (Mozilla,
      konqueror). [#980,2003-01-16,#965,2002-12-02]. Dominik, Dorothy is
      this fixed?

      [dv: i did not do anything about it yet]

  C.5 Gtk+-2 and window placement [#938,2.4,2002-10-18]

  C.8 An afterimage remains when moving a window [#913,2.4,2002-08-09].
      Not a bug?

  C.9 Moving operation delayed together with XFree86 4.2.0 xtt module
      [#903,2002-07-07] Not an fvwm bug?

  C.12 FvwmScript swallowexec doesn't work [#867,2.4,2002-04-01]

  C.15 Right mouse-click turn screen to black with xmgrace [#792,2.4,2001-10-10]
       Not a fvwm Bug?

  C.16 Redraw problem with netscape [#791,2.4,2001-10-10]. Not a fvwm Bug?

  C.17 Double scroll with mouse wheel [#782,2.4,2001-09-18].
       {Olivier: Cannot reproduce this with my touchpad wheel}

  C.18 Persistent Windows in Pager [#773,2.4,2001-09-18].
       {Olivier: Should be removed I think}

  C.19 fvwm 2.4.0 on HP-UX breaks xterm etc. [#767,2.4,2001-08-23]
       [dv: I can't imagine how fvwm would be involved, but do not have an
       HP-UX machine to test this]

  C.20 Erratic EdgeScroll behavior [#766,2.4,2001-08-21]. Fixed?

  C.23 Strange behavior with XForms "sliderall" demo [#758,2.4,2001-08-12].
       Fixed?
       [dv: Definitely not fixed.  Nobody did anything about it.]

  C.24 window appear/disappear in the Pager [#731,2.4,2001-07-04]. Fixed?
       [dv: no idea what has happened.  Maybe the pager running did not match
       the executable?  Delete this report.]


D. To be discussed
------------------

  D.1 Make the distinction between FVWM (project) and fvwm (core executable)?
      [dv: Against it.  I've never seen myself as being part of an 'FVWM
      project'.  I think this will only confuse people.  For me, fvwm is simply
      a name]
      [migo: Ok, so everyone does what he feels is good. For me it is confusing
      to use the same word to mean different things. Say, I'm an FVWM developer
      that means much more than a coder of the window manager executable fvwm,
      it also includes working on modules, documentation, perllib, web site,
      configs, rpms and much more that makes the whole thing - FVWM.]

  D.2 Leave or remove the current change to triggering bindings on button press
      or release?  Seems to irritate a lot of users, but fixes a root window
      binding bug.
      [dv: added on 29-Mar-2003]


E. To do
--------

  E.3 After F.1 try to find translator
      [Olivier]

  E.4 Move documentation from FvwmTheme.1 to fvwm.1 or create a separate
      man page fvwm-colorsets.1 (I prefer fvwm.1).
      [Mikhael]

  E.5 Disable Tear-off Menu by default (add --enable-tear-off-menu
      option to configure?)
      [dv: nope, please no more configure options]

  E.6 Rename FvwmProxy
      [dv: added on 02-Mar-2003]

  E.7 Fix the FvwmProxy placement algorithm (it may loop and can place windows
      off screen)
      [dv: added on 02-Mar-2003]

  E.11 Perl library: finalize API.
       [Mikhael]

  E.12 Perl Library: add event trackers.
       [Mikhael]

  E.13 Rename ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc to ~/.fvwm/main or ~/.fvwm/config.
       [Mikhael, after a notice and a possible discussion]
       [dv: why? it's only confusing]
       [migo: what is a non confusing name? The ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc is way too
        confusing for new/independent users, since it 1) is hidden (too bad),
        2) contains redundant substring (all files in ~/.fvwm belong to fvwm
        anyway), 3) contains some number that we don't use anywhere else.]
       [dv: it's just a convention.  Old time users don't like their config
        files being renamed or moved constantly.]
       [migo: all old config file names are supported until 3.0, the new name
        is designed to be final, so we will not need .fvwm2_6rc or .fvwm3rc]
       [Then, what is the point in making the change now?  It can as well wait
        until we start writing 3.0.]
       [It is the same reason as renaming fvwm2 to fvwm everywhere now.
        The executable file is fvwm in either 2.6, 3.0 or 4.5.
        The configuration file is ~/.fvwm/main in either 2.6, 3.0 or 4.5.]

  E.15 Complete FvwmWindowMenu to be more functional.
       [Mikhael (with help of Richard Lister?)]

  E.16 Rename all "Pixmap" in the syntax to "Image" while supporting both.
       Probably rename MultiPixmap to Multi, since it accepts Solid + Colorset.
       [Mikhael]

  E.17 Finally document the Repeat command.  Forgot that for years :-)
       [dv: added on 30-Apr-2003]


F. Distribution issues
----------------------

  F.1 Update the default config files, probably needs discussion...

  F.2 Update/complete fvwm-convert-2.6

  F.3 Check INSTALL.fvwm


G. Testing
----------

  G.1 Update and run the purify script again

  G.2 Test fvwm with GNOME2 and KDE3 [see in particular: #980]
      [Olivier: seems to work not so bad]

  G.3 Test fvwm with the latest SUN and IBM java [#654,#664,#707,#714,#863,#954]
      [dv:  That test will only prove that we did not do anything about these
      reports]

  G.4 Make some placement test with Tk?

  G.5 Is PositiveWrite module locking problem fixed? [e.g., #708]


---- Closed recently ----------------------------------------------------------

  E.10 Rename the "cond", "condcase", etc. commands
       [dv: added on 02-Mar-2003]
       [dv: done on 29-Jun-2003]

---- Postponed until after 2.6 ------------------------------------------------

  F.4 Translate our documentation into "xml/docbook" format

       (s)he is welcome]
