Possible things to do for perfect(?) Xinerama support:
------------------------------------------------------

 6) Commands and styles:
    a) EdgeResistance
    b) Move/Resize/Resizemove
    c) MoveToScreen
    d) Maximize
    e) Move/SnapAttraction: Limit SnapAttraction to windows on
       same screen.
       [not useful, EdgeResistance is good enough]
    f) MaxWindowSize
    g) General X geometry replacement (WxH+X+Y@Screen)?
    h) Like g, but for X resource strings?
    i) StartsOnScreen style?
    j) Adapt conditional commands and add new conditions
    k) WindowList command.
       [does not need new conditions]
 8) General/Performance:
    a) Introduce libs/Screen.c or something like that w/o Xinerama
       in the name.
       [replaced by 8f]
    b) Reduce number of XQueryPointer calls as much as possible.
    c) Use the Screen library always when screen dimensions are
       needed.
       [replaced by 8f]
    d) "Primary screen" concept
    e) Add additional pan frames?  If some screens have different
       sizes, part of a pan frame may be in the void and some
       screen edges won't allow paging.
    f) Clean up Xinerama library.
