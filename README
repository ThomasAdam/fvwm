Welcome to FVWM version 2.xx.  FVWM is a multiple large virtual
desktop window manager originally derived from twm.  FVWM is intended
to have a small memory footprint and a rich feature set, be extremely
customizable and extendable and have a high degree of Motif mwm
compatibility.

For old users of FVWM 1.xx, version 2.xx has a lot of differences.

FVWM's origninal author Rob Nation (THANKS ROB!) has "retired" from
work on it, so please don't bother him with silly little things like
bug reports or enhancement requests.  Care and feeding of FVWM is now
done by Brady Montz in his spare time, with help from everyone who
subscribes to the FVWM mailing lists and various other people all over
the world.

If you have any questions, concerns, bug reports, enhancement
requests, etc, *PLEASE* read the FAQ, BUGS, TO-DO and man files first,
otherwise known as RTFM, then try the FVWM mailing list.  You could
also check the official WWW page (see the FAQ for its URL) and the
mailing list archives found there.

(RTFM -> Read The Fine Manuals or Read The F!@#$%^ Manuals, depending
on the situation)

For info on compiling, check out the INSTALL file.

For known bugs, check out the BUGS, FAQ and TO-DO files.
