.SH NAME
xpmroot \- Sets the root window of the current X display to an Xpm pixmap

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xpmroot
.RB [ \-np ]
.RB [ \-d ]
.RB [ \-e ]
.I file

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I xpmroot
reads the Xpm file specified in the command line and displays it in the
root window.

.SH OPTIONS
\"needs_lang_check
These are the command line options that are recognized by xpmroot:
.TP
.BI "-np"
Causes xpmroot to do not keep the Xpm pixmap in permanent memory under
the _XSETROOT_ID property (_XSETROOT_ID is set to None).
.TP
.BI "-d"
Causes xpmroot to do not set the background but to free the memory
associated with the _XSETROOT_ID property (if any).
In any case the _XSETROOT_ID property is set to None and some programs
(as the fvwm2 modules) may use this to update its background if it is
transparent.
.TP
.BI "-fe"
Causes xpmroot to free the memory associated with the ESETROOT_PMAP_ID
property. This is useful if you use alternatively xpmroot and an
Esetroot compatible program.
\"end

.SH BUGS
Repeated use of xpmroot with different xpm pixmaps will use up slots in
your color table pretty darn fast.
