Beta testers needed:

You like fvwm and want to help? Become a beta tester. You can just
download the distribution and run your latest setup with the new beta,
but I you feel like doing something really helpful, pick an area
from the following list, try to test it as completely as you can and
report your test setup to the fvwm-workers mailing list.

<fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu>

 - Compile fvwm2 on as many different platforms and with as many combinations
   of options as you can (see INSTALL.fvwm for a list of options).

 - Try to break fvwm with exotic setups and syntax errors in the configuration
   file.

 - Play with the new menu features (animated menus, individual menu styles,
   position hints, cursor key movement etc.)

 - Test the new features in FvwmButtons (animated panels, button geometries,
   button placement algorithm). Panels are somewhat difficult to understand
   so please read the manpage (there are some examples).

 - Thorough test of FvwmPager. The configuration parser has been changed
   so every option should be tested.

 - Thorough test of FvwmIconMan. The configuration parser has been changed
   so every option should be tested.

 - Test the new module FvwmAnimate.

 - Test the new module FvwmEvent.
