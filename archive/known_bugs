 - FvwmSave and FvwmSaveDesk are not up to date.
 - Windows may grow a few pixels from time to time.

 - FvwmIconMan may crash during a 'Recapture'
 - FvwmButtons (and possibly other modules) may survive shutdown of the X
   server.
 - AutoHide in FvwmTaskBar does not work well. Should work if you set
   'EdgeScroll 0 0' in .fvwm2rc.
 - DestroyMenu/DestroyFunc causes a coredump if a function/menu destroys
   itself. 
 - Maximize does not work well when applied to wa window that is not on
   the current page.
 - A piperead command may hang if used in .fvwm2rc (if the pipe is never
   closed).
