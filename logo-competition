	The FVWM Logo Competition
	-------------------------

*** DRAFT ***

FVWM stands for F? Virtual Window Manager (see FAQ to get an idea
what F? may mean).  Historically, fvwm had no good logo, but this
is going to be changed.  With your help.

Competition Schedule
--------------------

  15-Apr/10-Aug
    Logo contributions are accepted.

  15-Aug/30-Aug
    The winning logo is elected.

  31-Aug
    The winning logo is proclaimed.

How your logo should look like
------------------------------

* The name "fvwm" must appear in the logo, without a version
  number (i.e. *not* as "fvwm2").

* We want to use your logo in different formats.  The actual size
  will depend on the logo.
   - On the fvwm web site (about 200x120, full colour)
   - As a banner for fvwm startup (about 300x180, 256 colours)
   - As a banner with only black and white (about 300x180)
   - Running up the left side of a menu (about 24x64, low color)

* You do not need to make all these different images yourself.
  Just draw a big image with all the colours you like and we will
  take care of the smaller versions.  Of course you may do that
  yourself too - your choice.

* What you should keep in mind is that the banners will be
  converted to XPM format and put in the distribution.  They
  should look good on any background and not occupy more than 40Kb
  after compression.

* Logos can be submitted in either XPM or PNG format.

Contributing your logo
----------------------

* Everybody may submit any number of logos by posting a url to the
  work or sending the images themselves as attachment (preferably
  compressed) to email address fvwm-logo@lists.sf.net.

* The contributed logos are exhibited at
  http://fvwm.org/logo-competition/

* Logos not created by the submitter or logos with illegal,
  discriminating or otherwise offensive contents, at the
  discretion of the fvwm developers, can not be accepted.

Copyrights and License
----------------------

* The artist retains full copyright of his or her work.

* By submitting a logo to the competition, the artist accepts that
  the logo is converted into XPM format (if necessary) and
  distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

There can be only one
---------------------

* In the election phase, one voting email per person can be sent to
  fvwm-logo@lists.sf.net.

* You can give one or no votes for each logo. The email should
  contain a list of logos for which you vote.  Give a vote for
  each logo you would enjoy to see as the official fvwm logo.

* The web interface is available too.

* The logo with the most votes wins.  It requires an easy email
  confirmation (using a mere reply) to disallow multiple voting.

* The above voting mode is meant to determine the logo that is
  accepted by the broadest range of users and not disliked strogly
  by a large fraction of fvwm users.

Gimme the Prize
---------------

* The prize for the new official fvwm logo is 100 Euro or the same
  amount in any other currency.
