	---------------------------

*** DRAFT ***

!!!
(give a short explanation what fvwm is and why it needs a new
logo)

1. Competition Schedule

* The logo competition begins on 15th of April, 2003.
* Contributions can be made up to and including the 31st of July.
* From the 3rd of August to the 30th of August, the winning logo
  will be elected by the fvwm users on the fvwm mailing list.
* The winner will be proclaimed on the 31st of August.

2. Logos

* Logos can be submitted in either XPM or PNG format.  All other
  formats, including .jpg and .gif are not accepted.
* The acceptable size of the logos is about between 240x150 pixels
  to 360x240 pixels.
* No more than 256 colours may be used.
* Transparency should be used to shape the image.
* As the winning logo is used as a banner, it should have a good
  contrast to any background.
* The submitted logos will be used at full size, scaled down to
  half size, and to a height of 16 pixels.
* The submitted logos will be converted to use no more than 16
  colours when packed into the fvwm distribution and should still
  look good.
* A version using only black and white will also be part of the
  distribution, so it must be possible to still recognize the logo
  with only two colours.
* The name "fvwm" must appear in the logo, without a version
  number (i.e. *not* as "fvwm2").

3. Contributing

* Everybody may participate in the competition with any number of
  contributions.
* Logos can be submitted by
  A. Posting the URL of the logo to fvwm@fvwm.org.
  B. Uploading the logo to ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/incoming/fvwm/
     and sending a mail to inform the fvwm@fvwm.org list of the
     upload.
  C. Sending the logo as an *aggressively compressed* attachment,
     no larger than 20kB to fvwm@fvwm.org.  Due to the possible
     number of contributions, larger files are *not* acceptable.
* For our convenience, please use the subject "[logo]" when you
  send a mail to fvwm@fvwm.org.
* The contributed logos will be exhibited on the logo web page:
  http://!!!
  in the three sizes mentioned above, with full colour and with 16
  colours.
* Logos with illegal, discriminating or otherwise offensive
  contents, at the discretion of the fvwm developers, will not be
  accepted.

4. Copyrights and License

* The artist retains full copyright of his or her work.
* By submitting a logo to the competition, the artist accepts that
  the logo is converted into XPM format (if necessary) and
  distributed under the terms of the Gnu General Public License
  (GPL).  !!!Link to GPL.

5. Voting Rules

* In the election phase, votes are sent to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org.
* Everybody may vote only only once.
* You can give one or no votes for any number of logos. The voting
  email should contain a list of logos for which you vote.  Give a
  vote for each logo you would enjoy to see as the official fvwm
  logo.
* The logo with the most votes wins.
* The above voting mode is meant to determine the logo that is
  accepted by the broadest range of users and not disliked strogly
  by a large fraction of fvwm users.
* Although everybody may count the votes sent to the fvwm-workers
  mailing list, the current standings of the election will only be
  published when the polls are closed.

6. The winner

* The winning logo will be shipped with the fvwm distribution
  (hopefully in 2.6.0) and used as:

  - A startup banner with the FvwmBanner module at full size.
  - As a banner on the fvwm web site at full or half size.
  - At tiny size, rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise as a menu
    side bar.
