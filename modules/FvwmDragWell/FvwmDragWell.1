.SH NAME
FvwmDragWell \- A XDND drag well
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBFvwmDragWell\fP

FvwmDragWell is a Xdnd drag well.  The user sends the data and type to
the drag well via a fvwm2 SendToModule command.  The drag well
indicates that it received the information via a crude animation.  The
user may then drag the information from the well to other applications
that support the Xdnd standard.  The fvwm2 module FvwmWharf accepts
drops of type "text/uri-list".

.SH INITIALIZATION
During initialization, \fIFvwmDragWell\fP gets config info from
\fBfvwm\fP's module configuration database (see 
.IR fvwm2 (1),
section
.BR "MODULE COMMANDS" ).
If the FvwmDragWell executable is linked to another name, i.e. ln -s
FvwmDragWell OtherDragWell, then another module called OtherDragWell
can be started, with a completely different configuration than
FvwmDragWell, simply by changing the keyword FvwmDragWell to
OtherDragWell. This way multiple FvwmDragWell programs may be used.

.SH USE
Data is sent to the module from fvwm using the SendToModule Command.
The form of the send to module command is:
.nf
.sp
SendToModule modulename dragtype type-string, dragdata data
.sp
.fi
type-string is a quoted string that declares the type of
"data" and how the data will be exported.  The "typestring" string is
converted to an XAtom.  The user should use standard Mime type
strings, all in lower case.  Note that the module does no data
conversion.

There is one exception to the above format.  If the datatype string is
omitted, the module assumes that the user is passing a file or
directory path.  In this case, the string "file://$hostname/" is
prepended to the data, and the data is exported as type
"text/uri-list".

Examples:
.nf
.sp
SendToModule FvwmDragWell dragdata /usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.4.0
.sp
.fi

On hostname saturn, the drag well will convert the data to
"file://saturn/usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.4.0"
and will export the data as type "text/uri-list".  The long form of
this command would be
.nf
.sp
SendToModule FvwmDragWell dragtype text/uri-list, \\
	dragdata file://saturn/usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.3.8
.sp
.fi

.SH INVOCATION
FvwmDragWell must be invoked from fvwm2, so no command line invocation
will work.


.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
FvwmDragWell reads the same .fvwm2rc file as fvwm reads when it starts up,
and looks for certain configuration options:


.IP "*FvwmDragWell: Geometry \fIgeometry\fP"
Completely or partially specifies the Fvwm window location and
geometry, in standard X11 notation. The default size is 48x48.

.IP "*FvwmDragWell: DragWellGeometry \fIgeometry\fP"
Specifies the geometry of the drag box in the FvwmDragWell window, in
the standard X11 notation.  Default is 30x30+9+9


.IP "*FvwmDragWell: Colorset  \fIcolorset\fP"
The colorset is used for the background and shading of the drag well.
See the man page of FvwmTheme for a description of colorsets.

.IP "*FvwmDragWell: Fore \fIColor\fP"
The foreground color.  The default foreground color is grey60.

.IP "*FvwmDragWell: Back \fIColor\fP"
The background color.  The default background color is black.

.IP "*FvwmDragWell: Shadow \fIColor\fP"
The shadow color of the button relief. The default foreground relief
color is grey20.

.IP "*FvwmDragWell: Hilite \fIColor\fP"
The hilight color of the button relief. The default background relief
color is grey90.
