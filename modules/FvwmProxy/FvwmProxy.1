.SH NAME
FvwmProxy \- the FVWM Proxy module
.SH SYNOPSIS
FvwmProxy is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The FvwmProxy allows the user to locate and control windows obscured
by other windows by using small non-overlapping proxy windows.
The current capabilites include raising and lowering the proxied windows.

Holding the Alt key activates the proxy windows.
Proxy windows are always on top and try to center on the regular
window they proxy.
A simple collision algorithm tweaks the positions of the proxy windows
to prevent them from overlapping.
Pressing the left or right mouse buttons on a proxy window
raises or lowers the assiciated proxied window respectively.

.SH INITIALIZATION


.SH INVOCATION
FvwmProxy can be invoked by inserting the line 'Module FvwmProxy' in
the .fvwm2rc file. This can be placed on a line by itself, if FvwmProxy
is to be spawned during fvwm's initialization, or can be bound to a
menu or mouse button or keystroke to invoke it later. Fvwm will search
directory specified in the ModulePath configuration option to attempt
to locate FvwmProxy.

You may optionally use the following arguments when invoking FvwmProxy:
