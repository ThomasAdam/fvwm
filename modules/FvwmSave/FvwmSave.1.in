.SH NAME
FvwmSave \- the FVWM desktop-layout saving module
.SH SYNOPSIS
FvwmSave is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

.SH DESCRIPTION
When called, this module will attempt to save your current desktop
layout into a file called new.xinitrc. Ideally, this file will look just
like .xinitrc, but in reality, you will have to edit it to get a
usable configuration, so be sure to keep a backup of your old .xinitrc.

Your applications must supply certain hints to the X window system.
Emacs, for example, does not, so FvwmSave can't get any
information from it.

Also, FvwmSave assumes that certain command line options are
globally accepted by applications, which may not be the case.
