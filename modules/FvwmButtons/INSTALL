How to install FvwmButtons in the fvwm-2.0.41 tree.

NOTE: If you don't want to overwrite the old FvwmButtons, you should change
all "FvwmButtons" below to some other name like "NewButtons". You should also
edit the last line in the Imakefile to read "FvwmModuleTarget(NewButtons)".

1) Untar the distribution inside fvwm-2.0.41/modules/FvwmButtons

3) In that directory, type
	xmkmf; make clean; make install
   No need to recompile the whole thing :-) Unless of course you have applied
   any of the related patches.

4) Fire up FvwmTalk and try:  FvwmButtons SomeName /full/path/to/samplebuttonrc
   (or NewButtons if that is what you called it)
   This should produce a nice buttonbox on your screen. Try rescaling it a
   little, maybe edit the file and experiment.

5) If this did not work, check the error output from fvwm, this might provide
   some info on what's wrong. Send the complete output to me if you like.
   You can make it produce lot of output by uncommenting some of the DEBUG
   defines in FvwmButtons.h.
