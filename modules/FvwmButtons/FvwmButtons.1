.SH NAME
FvwmButtons \- the FVWM buttonbox module
.SH SYNOPSIS
FvwmButtons is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The FvwmButtons module provides a window of buttons which sits on the X
terminal's root window. The user can press the buttons at any time,
and trigger invocation of a user-specified command by the window
manager. FvwmButtons only works when fvwm is used as the window manager.

The buttonbox can be of any configuration or geometry, and can have
monochrome or color icons to represent the actions which would be
invoked.

.SH INITIALIZATION
During initialization, \fIFvwmButtons\fP will search for a configuration
file which describes the buttonbox geometry, color, icons, and
actions. The format of
this files will be described later. The configuration file will be the
one which fvwm used during its initialization.

To use FvwmButtons with several different configurations, you can
invoke FvwmButtons with an optional parameter, which it will use
as its name instead (e.g "Module FvwmButtons SomeButtons").
SomeButtons will then read only the lines in the configuration file
starting with "*SomeButtons", and not the lines belonging to FvwmButtons.

You can also specify an optional configuration file to use instead of
the default fvwm configuration file, by giving a second argument which
is a filename. This will override the setting "*FvwmButtonsFile", see
below.

.SH INVOCATION
FvwmButtons can be invoked by inserting the line 'Module FvwmButtons' in
the .fvwmrc file. This should be placed in the InitFunction if FvwmButtons
is to be spawned during fvwm's initialization, or can be bound to a
menu or mouse button or keystroke to invoke it later. Fvwm will search
directory specified in the ModulePath configuration option to attempt
to locate FvwmButtons.

.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
The following options int the .fvwmrc file are understood by FvwmButtons:
.IP "*FvwmButtonsBack \fIcolor\fP"
Specifies the background color for the buttons. A relief and a shadow color
will also be calculated from this.
.IP "*FvwmButtonsBoxSize \fIalgorithm\fP"
This option specifies how serious FvwmButtons takes the Rows and Colums
options (see below). It can be one of \fIdumb\fP, \fIfixed\fP or \fIsmart\fP.
If fixed is given and both Rows and Columns are specified and non-zero,
FvwmButtons will use exactly this numbers of rows and columns of button. If
the box is too small to accomodate all buttons the module will fail. Using
the smart option FvwmButtons is intelligent enough to enlarge the box so
all buttons have a chance to fit. The number of columns is increased to at
least the width of the widest button and new rows are added until all buttons
can be placed. For best tolerance of configuration of errors use the
smart option.
.IP "*FvwmButtonsCloseOnSelect\fP"
This option is only valid for panels.  Calling any action within a panel closes
the panel.  With the opposite option \fIStayUpOnSelect\fP the panel never
closes when pressing anything inside it.  The default is to close the panel
if the action executed begins with 'Exec'.
.IP "*FvwmButtonsColumns \fIcolumns\fP"
Specifies the number of columns of buttons to be created. If unspecified,
the number of columns will be set to the number of buttons requested,
divided by the number of rows. If both the rows and columns are
specified, but do not specify as many buttons as are defined, then the
users columns specification will be ignored unless the value \fIfixed\fP
was gived to the \fIBoxSize\fP option (see there).
.IP "*FvwmButtonsFile \fIfilename\fP"
Specifies that the configuration for this button is found in the file
\fIfilename\fP, which will have to be given with full pathname, or is
assumed to be in fvwm's startup directory. The configuration file is in
the same format as fvwm's configuration file, but each line is read as
if prefixed by "*FvwmButtons". Comments are given by starting a line with
"#", line continuation is done by ending a line with a "\\".
.IP "*FvwmButtonsFont \fIfont\fP"
Specifies the font to be used for labeling the buttons, or \fINone\fP.
.IP "*FvwmButtonsFore \fIcolor\fP"
Specifies the color used for button label text and monochrome icons.
.IP "*FvwmButtonsFrame \fIwidth\fP"
Specifies the width of the relief around each button. If this is given
as a negative number, the relief will at all times be the inverse of the
normal relief. In effect, you will get a sunken button, which is raised when
activated.
.IP "*FvwmButtonsGeometry \fIgeometry\fP"
Specifies the FvwmButtons window location. The size should not be specified,
as FvwmButtons automatically chooses a size which gracefully accomodates
all its buttons. The geometry is a standard X11 window geometry specification.
.IP "*FvwmButtonsPadding \fIwidth height\fP"
The amount of free space between the relief of the button and its contents
is normally 2 pixels to the sides and 4 pixels above and below, except for
swallowed windows and containers, which are not padded at all, unless
given specific orders. This setting
specifies the default horizontal padding to be \fIwidth\fP pixels, and the
vertical padding to be \fIheight\fP pixels.
.IP "*FvwmButtonsPanel \fItitle\fP"
Specifies the title of a panel. All following *FvwmButtons
configuration commands up to the next *FvwmButtonsPanel line
refer to the panel.
.IP "*FvwmButtonsPixmap \fIpixmapfile\fP"
Specifies a background pixmap to use.  Specify "none" for a transparent
background.
.IP "*FvwmButtonsRows \fIrows\fP"
Specifies the number of rows of buttons to be created. If unspecified,
2 rows will be used.
.IP "*FvwmButtonsStayUpOnSelect\fP"
See \f*FvwmButtonsCloseOnSelect\fP.
.IP "*FvwmButtons(\fIoptions\fP) [\fItitle icon command\fP]"
Specifies the contents of a button in the buttonbox.
The following \fIoptions\fP, separated by commas or whitespace, can be
given a button:
.IP "  \fIgeometry\fP"
Specifies the size and position of the button within the FvwmButtons window
or container. The button will be \fIwidth\fP times the normal button width
and \fIheight\fP times the normal button height. If values for \fIx\fP and
\fIy\fP are given, the button is placed x (y) button units from the left
(top) of the container if x (y) is positive and x (y) units from the right
(bottom) if x (y) is negative. The geometry is a standard X11 window geometry
specification. Buttons with position arguments (x and y) are placed before
thos without them. If two or more buttons are forced to overlap by this,
FvwmButton exits with an error message.
.IP "  Action [(\fIoptions\fP)] \fIcommand\fP"
Specifies an fvwm command to be executed when the button is activated
by pressing return or a mouse button. The \fIcommand\fP needs to be
quoted if it contains a comma or a closing parenthesis. The current
options are:

Mouse \fIn\fP - this action is only executed for mouse button \fIn\fP.
One actions can be defined for each mouse button, in addition to the
general action.
.IP "  Back \fIcolor\fP"
Specifies the background color to be used drawing this box. A relief color
and a shadow color will also be calculated from this.
.IP "  Center"
The contents of the button is centered on the button. This is the default but
may be changed by \fILeft\fP or \fIRight\fP.
.IP "  Container [(\fIoptions\fP)]"
Specifies that this button will contain a miniature buttonbox, more or less
equivalent to swallowing another FvwmButtons module. The options are the
same as can be given for a single button, but they affect all
the contained buttons. Options available for this use are \fIBack, Font,
Fore, Frame\fP and \fIPadding\fP. Flags for Title and Swallow options can
be set with \fITitle(flags)\fP and \fISwallow(flags)\fP.
You should also specify either "Columns \fIwidth\fP" or "Rows \fIheight\fP",
or "Rows 2" will be assumed for purpose of arranging the buttons inside
the container. For an example, see the \fISample configuration\fP section.

The container button itself (separate from the contents) can take format
options like
\fIFrame\fP and \fIPadding\fP, and commands can be bound to it. This means
you can make a sensitive relief around a container, like

  *FvwmButtons(2x2, Frame 5, Padding 2 2, Action Beep,\\
      Container(Frame 1))

Typically you will want to at least give the container a size setting
\fIwidth\fPx\fIheight\fP.

.IP "  End"
Specifies that no more buttons are defined for the current container, and
further buttons will be put in the container's parent. This option should
be given on a line by itself, i.e

  *FvwmButtons(End)
.IP "  Font \fIfontname\fP"
Specifies that the font \fIfontname\fP is to be used for labeling this button.
.IP "  Fore \fIcolor\fP"
Specifies a color of the title and monochrome icons in this button.
.IP "  Frame \fIwidth\fP"
The relief of the button will be \fIwidth\fP pixels wide. If \fIwidth\fP
is given as a negative number, the
relief will at all times be the inverse of the normal relief.
In effect, you will get a sunken button, which is raised when activated.
.IP "  Icon \fIfilename\fP"
The name of an X11 bitmap file or XPM color icon file, containing the
icon to display on the button. FvwmButtons will search through the path
specified in the fvwm ImagePath
configuration item to find the icon file.
.IP "  Left"
The contents of the button will be aligned to the left. The default is to
center the contents on the button.
.IP "  NoSize"
This option specifies that this button will not be considered at all when
making the initial calculations of buttonsizes. Useful for the odd button
that gets just a couple of pixels to large to keep in line, and therefor
blows up your whole buttonbox. "NoSize" is equivalent to "Size 0 0".
.IP "  Padding \fIwidth height\fP"
The amount of free space between the relief of the button and its contents
is normally 2 pixels to the sides and 4 pixels above and below, except
for swallowed windows and containers, which are by default not padded at all.
This option sets the horizontal padding to \fIwidth\fP and the vertical
padding to \fIheight\fP.
.IP "  Panel [ (\fIdirection\fP) ] \fIname\fP"
Pop up a panel in the specified \fIdirection\fP from the
invoking button. A position set with *FvwmButtonsGeometry is taken
as a relative offset to this position. \fIdirection\fP may be
"up" (the default), "left", "down" od "right". The panel is a
button bar itself. See \fIFvwmButtonsPanel\fP. To get the panel
at a specific place on the screen use "geometry" in place of the
direction. The *FvwmButtonsGeometry line will then be treated as
a normal X geometry specification.
.IP "  Right"
The contents of the button will be aligned to the Right. The default is to
center the contents on the button.
.IP "  Size \fIwidth height\fP"
Specifies that the contents of this button will require \fIwidth\fP by
\fIheight\fP pixels, regardless of what size FvwmButtons calculates from
the icon and the title. A buttonbar with only swallowed windows will
not get very large without this option specified, as FvwmButtons does not
consider sizes for swallowing buttons. Note that this option gives the
minimum space assured; other buttons might require the buttonbox to use
larger sizes.
.IP "  Swallow [(\fIflags\fP)] \fIhangon\fP \fIcommand\fP"
Causes FvwmButtons to execute \fIcommand\fP, and when a window matching the
name \fIhangon\fP appears, it is captured and swallowed into this button.
An example:

  *FvwmButtons(Swallow XClock 'Exec xclock &')

will take the first window whose name, class or resource is "XClock" and
display it in the button. Modules can be swallowed by specifying
the module instead of 'Exec whatever', like:

  *FvwmButtons(Swallow "FvwmPager" "FvwmPager 0 0")

The flags that can be given to swallow are:

NoClose / Close -
Specifies whether the swallowed program in this button will be unswallowed
or closed when FvwmButtons exit cleanly. "NoClose" can be combined with
"UseOld" to have windows survive restart of windowmanager. The default
setting is "Close".

NoHints / Hints -
Specifies whether hints from the swallowed program in this
button will be ignored or not, useful in forcing a window to resize itself
to fit its button. The default value is "Hints".

NoKill / Kill -
Specifies whether the swallowed program will be closed by killing it or by
sending a message to it. This can be useful in ending programs that
doesn't accept window manager protocol. The default value is "NoKill".
This has no effect if "NoClose" is specified.

NoRespawn / Respawn -
Specifies whether the swallowed program is to be respawn if it dies.
If "Respawn" is specified, the program will be respawned using the original
\fIcommand\fP. Use this option with care, the program might have a very
legitimate reason to die.

NoOld / UseOld -
Specifies whether the button will try to swallow an existing window matching
the \fIhangon\fP name before spawning one itself with \fIcommand\fP.
The default value is "NoOld".
"UseOld" can be combined with "NoKill" to have windows survive restart of
windowmanager. If you want FvwmButtons to swallow an old window, and not
spawn one itself if failing, let the \fIcommand\fP be "Nop":

  *FvwmButtons(Swallow (UseOld) "Console" Nop)

If you want to be able to start it yourself, combine it with an action:

  *FvwmButtons(Swallow (UseOld) "Console" Nop, \\
               Action `Exec "Console" console &`)

NoTitle / UseTitle -
Specifies whether the title of the button will be taken from the swallowed
window's title or not. If "UseTitle" is given, the title on the button will
change dynamically to reflect the window name. The default is "NoTitle".

.IP "  Title [(\fIoptions\fP)] \fIname\fP"
Specifies the title which will be written on the button.
Whitespace can be included in the title by quoting it.
If a title at any time is to long for
its buttons, characters are chopped of one at a time until it fits.
If \fIjustify\fP is "Right", the head is removed, otherwise its tail is
removed.
These \fIoptions\fP can be given to Title:

Center - The title will be centered horizontally. This is the default.

Left - The title will be justified to the left side.

Right - The title will be justified to the right side.

Side - This will cause the title to appear on the right hand side of
any icon or swallowed window, instead of below it which is the default.
If you use small icons, and combine this with the "Left" or "Right" option,
you can get a look similar to fvwm's menus.
.IP "Legacy fields [\fItitle icon command\fP]"
These fields are kept for compatibility with previous versions of
FvwmButtons, and their use is discouraged.
The \fItitle\fP field is similar to the option
Title \fIname\fP. If the title field is "-", no title will be displayed.
The \fIicon\fP field is similar to the option
Icon \fIfilename\fP. If the icon field is "-" no icon will be displayed.
The \fIcommand\fP field is similar to the option
Action \fIcommand\fP or alternatively Swallow "\fIhangon\fP" \fIcommand\fP.
.IP "The \fIcommand\fP"
Any fvwm command is recognized by FvwmButtons. See fvwm(1) for more info
on this. The Exec command has a small extension when used in Actions,
its syntax is here:

  Exec ["hangon"] command

When FvwmButtons finds such an Exec command, the button will remain
pushed in until a window whose name or class matches the
qouted portion of the command is encountered. This is intended to
provide visual feedback to the user that the action he has requested
will be performed. If the qouted portion
contains no characters, then the button will pop out immediately.
Note that users can continue pressing the button, and re-executing the
command, even when it looks "pressed in."
.IP "Quoting"
Any string which contains whitespace must be quoted. Contrary to
earlier versions commands no longer need to be quoted. In this
case any quoting character will be passed on to the application
untouched. Only commas ',' and closing parentheses ')' have to
be quoted inside a command.
Quoting can be done with any of the three quotation characters;
single quote:

  'This is a "quote"',

double quote:

  "It's another `quote'",

and backquote:

  `This is a strange quote`.

The backquoting is purposeful
if you use a preprocessor like FvwmCpp and want it to get into your
commands, like this:

  #define BG gray60
  *FvwmButtons(Swallow "xload" `Exec xload -bg BG &`)

Furthermore a single character can be quoted with a preceding
backslash '\'.

.SH ARRANGEMENT ALGORITHM

FvwmButtons tries to arrange its buttons as best it can, by using
recursively, on each container including the buttonbox itself,
the following algorithm.
.IP "Getting the size right"
First it calculates the number of button unit areas it will need, by adding
the width times the height in buttons of each button. Containers are
for the moment considered a normal button.
Then it considers the given \fIrows\fP and \fIcolumns\fP arguments.
If the number of rows is given, it will calculate how many columns are needed,
and stick to that, unless \fIcolumns\fP is larger, in which case you will
get some empty space at the bottom of the buttonbox.
If the number of columns is given, it calculates how many rows it needs
to fit all the buttons.
If neither is given, it assumes you want two rows, and finds the number of
columns from that.
If the BoxSize option is set to \fIsmart\fP at least the height/width of
the tallest/widest button is used while the \fIfixed\fP value prevents the
box from getting resized if both \fIrows\fP and \fIcolums\fP have been set
to non-zero.
.IP "Shuffling buttons"
Now it has a large enough area to place the buttons in, all that is left is
to place them right. There are two kinds ob buttons: fixed and floating
buttons. A fixed button is forced to a specific slot in the button box by
a x/y geometry argument. All other buttons are considered floating. Fixed
buttons are placed first. Should a fixed button overlap another one or shall
be place outside the buttons window, FvwmButtons exits with an error message.
After that the floating buttons are placed.
The algorithm tries to place the buttons in a left to right, top to bottom
western fashion. If a button fits at the suggested position it is placed
there, if not the current slot stays empty and the slot to the right will
be considered. After the button has been placed, the next button is tried
to be placed in the next slot and so on until all buttons are placed.
Additional rows are added below the bottom line of buttons until all buttons
are placed if necessary if the BoxSize option \fIsmart\fP is used.
.IP "Containers"
Containers are arranged by the same algorithm, in fact they are shuffled
recursively as the algorithm finds them.
.IP "Clarifying example"
An example might be useful here: Suppose you have 6 buttons, all unit sized
except number two, which is 2x2. This makes for 5 times 1 plus 1 times 4
equals 9 unit buttons total area. Assume you have requested 3 columns.

.IP "What size will the buttons be?"
When FvwmButtons has read the icons and fonts that are required by its
configuration, it can find out which size is needed for every non-swallowing
button. The unit button size of a container is set to be large enough to
hold the largest button in it without squeezing it. Swallowed windows
are simply expected to be comfortable with the buttonsize they get
from this scheme. If a particular configuration requires more space
for a swallowed window, it can be set in that button's configuration line
using the option "Size \fIwidth height\fP". This will tell FvwmButtons
to give this button at least \fIwidth\fP by \fIheight\fP pixels inside
the relief and padding.

The last lines are a little tricky - one spawns an FvwmPager module, and
captures it to display in a quadruple width button.
is used, the Pager will be as big as possible within the button's relief.

The final line is even more magic. Note the combination of \fIUseOld\fP
and \fINoKill\fP, which will try to swallow an existing window with the
name "xload15" when starting up (if failing: starting one with the
specified command), which is unswallowed when ending FvwmButtons.

The color specification \fIrgb:90/80/90\fP is actually the most
correct way of specifying independent colors in X, and should be
used instead of the older \fI#908090\fP. If the latter specification
is used in your configuration file, you should be sure to escape
the hash in any of the \fIcommand\fPs which will be executed, or
fvwm will consider the rest of the line a comment.

Note that with the x/y geometry specs you can easily build button
windows with gaps. Here is another example. You can not accomplish
this without geometry specs for the buttons:
