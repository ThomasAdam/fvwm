.SH NAME
FvwmBacker \- the FVWM background changer module
.SH SYNOPSIS
FvwmBacker is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

.SH DESCRIPTION

The FvwmBacker module provides functionality to change the background
when changing desktops.  Any command can be executed to change the
backgrounds.  Actually, any arbitrary command can be sent to fvwm to
execute, so you could also do things such as changing window border
colors, etc.

.SH COPYRIGHTS
The FvwmBacker module is the original work of Mike Finger.

Copyright 1994, Mike Finger. The author makes no guarantees or
warranties of any kind about the use of this module.  Use this modules
at your own risk.  You may freely use this module or any portion of it
for any purpose as long as the copyright is kept intact.

.SH INITIALIZATION
During initialization, \fIFvwmBacker\fP will scan the same
configuration file that FVWM used during startup to find the options
that pertain to it.  These options are discussed in a later section.

.SH INVOCATION
FvwmBacker can be invoked by fvwm during initialization by inserting
the line

.nf
AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmBacker
.fi

in the .fvwm2rc file.

FvwmBacker can be started using a 'Module FvwmBacker' command or stopped
using a 'KillModule FvwmBacker' command at any time when fvwm is running.

FvwmBacker must reside in a directory that is listed in the ModulePath
option of FVWM for it to be executed by FVWM.

.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
The following is the only supported option at present:

.IP "*FvwmBackerCommand \fI(Desk d, Page x y) command\fP"
Specifies the \fIcommand\fP to execute when the viewport matches the
arguments for the desk d, page x coordinate and y coordinate. Any or all of
these three numeric arguments can be replaced with an asterisk (*) to indicate
that any value matches, in this case Desk or Page parts can be skipped.

If the \fIcommand\fP is \fI-solid\fP FvwmBacker uses the next
argument as a color in the X database and sets the background to that
color without generating a system call to xsetroot (only single word
color names may be used).

If the \fIcommand\fP is \fIcolorset\fP FvwmBacker uses the background
specified in colorset \fIn\fP for the given desk.  Please refer to
the man page of the FvwmTheme module for details about colorsets.

Otherwise the command is sent to fvwm to execute.

Note these three lines are equivalent:

.nf
.sp
*FvwmBackerCommand (Page * *, Desk *) -solid navy
*FvwmBackerCommand () -solid navy
*FvwmBackerCommand -solid navy
.sp
.fi

.SH OLD-STYLE OPTIONS
There is continued support for the now deprecated option:

.IP "*FvwmBackerDesk \fId command\fP"

It is functionally equivalent to using an asterisk for both page
coordinates with \fI*FvwmBackerCommand\fP.

.SH SAMPLE CONFIGURATION
The following are excepts from an .fvwm2rc file which describe
FvwmBacker initialization commands:

.nf
.sp
####
# Set Up Backgrounds for different desktop pages (2 desks, 3x2 pages).
