This is FvwmForm 1.0a.  You should find the following files:

README 		this file.
Changes		changes log.
FvwmForm.c	source code.
Makefile	make file for my environment (at Princeton, SunOS 4.1.3).
FvwmForm.1	man page, in nroff format.

You may need to change Makefile slightly for your environment.  Also,
I do not have access to many different platforms to test this program,
so you may need to adjust other things too.

Thank you for using FvwmForm.  Please report bugs to me.

------------------------------------------------------------------

And now,  (January 1998),  we  have FvwmForm 2.0.   (Actually FvwmForm
doesn't  have a version number,  it shares  the fvwm version number.)
In addition to the files above, you will find:

.FormFvwmCapture	Installed Window Capture from man page
.FormFvwmQuitVerify	Installed MWM Quit/Verify from man page
.FormFvwmRlogin		Installed Rlogin from man page

The Makefile is  gone and  the comment about   changing it no   longer
applies  as  FvwmForm is now  part  of  Fvwm.  Similarly,  bug reports
should be reported  in the same  manner as any   other fvwm bug.   The
"Changes" file is also out of  use.  Fvwm ChangeLog facilities are now
being used.
