This is FvwmForm 1.0a.  You should find the following files:

README 		this file.
Changes		changes log.
FvwmForm.c	source code.
Makefile	make file for my environment (at Princeton, SunOS 4.1.3).
FvwmForm.1	man page, in nroff format.

You may need to change Makefile slightly for your environment.  Also,
I do not have access to many different platforms to test this program,
so you may need to adjust other things too.

Thank you for using FvwmForm.  Please report bugs to me.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently in addition to the files above, you will find:

FvwmFrom-Capture        A form for Window Capture from man page
FvwmForm-QuitVerify     A form simulaing MWM Quit/Verify from man page
FvwmForm-Rlogin         A form for Remote login from man page

FvwmForm-Form           A form to define characteristics of all FvwmForm's
FvwmForm-RootCursor     A form to set a root cursor
FvwmForm-Setup          A form to set up an initial FVWM configuration
FvwmForm-Talk           A form implementing Fvwm Talk

The Makefile is  gone and  the comment about   changing it no   longer
applies  as  FvwmForm is now  part  of  Fvwm.  Similarly,  bug reports
should be reported  in the same  manner as any   other fvwm bug.   The
"Changes" file is also out of  use.  Fvwm ChangeLog facilities are now
being used.
