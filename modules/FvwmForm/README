This is FvwmForm 1.0a.  You should find the following files:

README 		this file.
Changes		changes log.
FvwmForm.c	source code.
Makefile	make file for my environment (at Princeton, SunOS 4.1.3).
FvwmForm.1	man page, in nroff format.

You may need to change Makefile slightly for your environment.  Also,
I do not have access to many different platforms to test this program, 
so you may need to adjust other things too.

Thank you for using FvwmForm.  Please report bugs to me.
