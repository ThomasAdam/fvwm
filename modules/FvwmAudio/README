This is the first version of the FvwmAudio module.  This program must
be compiled in the fvwm/modules/FvwmAudio directory.

This module can play different sounds depending on message types.   

The following can be specified in your .fvwmrc:

Here's a sample:
*FvwmAudioPlayCmd /usr/bin/X11/demos/auplay
*FvwmAudioDir /usr/lib/sounds
*FvwmAudio startup Cheers.au
*FvwmAudio shutdown Goodbye.au
*FvwmAudio unknown doh.au
*FvwmAudio add_window drip.au
*FvwmAudio raise_window beep_pure_saw.au
*FvwmAudio lower_window beep_pure_saw.au
*FvwmAudio focus_change tap2.au
*FvwmAudio destroy_window beep_drop_of_water.au
*FvwmAudio iconify ploop.au
*FvwmAudio deiconify beep_kind_warning.au

Note that startup, shutdown, and unknown are builtin sound events that are 
played when the module begins, ends, and when an unknown message is received.

Sounds can be played using any independent audio player that can accept
filenames a command line argument.

This version of FvwmAudio has builtin rplay support which does not need to
invoke an external audio player to play sounds.  The rplay support is
enabled when FvwmAudio is compiled with HAVE_RPLAY defined (see the Imakefile)
and when FvwmAudioPlayCmd is set to builtin-rplay.  rplay can be obtained
via anonymous ftp at ftp.sdsu.edu in the /pub/rplay directory and at
ftp.x.org in the /contrib/audio/rplay directory.
