This is version 1.3 of FvwmIconMan, an icon manager modeled roughly on TWM's
icon manager. The file CHANGES lists what's new with this version; and the
included man page gives a description of the program and how to configure it,
so I won't repeat it here.

This version of FvwmIconMan can use MiniIcons and the Shape extension. If you
want to use these features, you should have the appropriate defines set in 
the Fvwm.tmpl file. 

If something needs to be tweaked to make this more portable, then feel free to
inform me, and I would greatly appreciate any suggestions towards improvement.

I realize that the syntax for setting options is different from that used by
other modules.

I have discontinued support for fvwm 1. If you need to compile it for that
version of fvwm, send me mail, and I'll tell you how. The version of
FvwmIconMan included in the fvwm 2.0 distribution WILL NOT run under fvwm 1.
