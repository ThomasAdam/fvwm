12/31/97	Version 1.1:
			When drawicons option is set to "always", always draw
				the miniicons, regardless of whether the
				windows are iconifed (from Neil Moore). A sad
				result of setting this is that there is no
				visual indication of which windows are
				iconified. Since that code is due for cleanup
				anyway, I'll handle that later.
			sort option now takes one of these values: name, id,
				or none.

2/5/97		Version 0.9.3
			Fixed bug where if a window moves from one manager
				to another (which can happen while FvwmIconMan
				is receiving the window list from fvwm), it 
				can end up using the format string of the 
				wrong manager.

				that causes it to be removed from manager,
				it core dumps.
