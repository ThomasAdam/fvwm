 - If icon-file is not given, look for a file called xx.icon in the
   pixmap/bitmap directory, where xx is resource, class or window name 
   (like 4Dwm. I don't know if this should be implemented in Fvwm or
   in this module...)  

 - "Page" option for *FvwmIconBoxResolution.

 - Allows icons movable like mwm?

 - Make my broken English get much better :)
