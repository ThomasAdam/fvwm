	* FvwmPager/FvwmPager.1:
	* FvwmIdent/FvwmIdent.1: Fixes from Austin Donelly.

	* FvwmIconMan/readconfig.c: Removed stripcpy, since it is
	identical to the function already available in libfvwm.  Renamed
	the static GetNextToken() to internal_GetNextToken() to avoid
	compiler warnings (a non-static version exists in libfvwm).

	* FvwmEvent/Makefile.am (LDADD): Added rplay_LIBS.
	* FvwmEvent/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Added rplay_CFLAGS.

	* FvwmAudio/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Added rplay_CFLAGS.
