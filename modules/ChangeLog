1998-12-12  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* FvwmPager/x_pager.c (initialize_pager): fixed bug: balloons were
	shown on the pager with the 'Icon' option initially. After iconify-
	deiconify this was right.

	* FvwmPager/FvwmPager.c (ParseOptions): *FvwmPagerBalloons Icon/Pager
	did not switch off the other type if both were used.

	* FvwmButtons/parse.c:
	* FvwmButtons/output.c:
	* FvwmButtons/FvwmButtons.c: panel bugfixes by J Joshua Feng

	* FvwmPager/x_pager.c:
	* FvwmPager/FvwmPager.1: applied ballon window flip patch by Ric Lister

	* FvwmPager/x_pager.c (MapBalloonWindow): fixed possible coredump (t
	referenced but NULL)
	(MapBalloonWindow): OK, bug #49 is now really fixed. Although the
	mentioned Enter/Leave Notify loop is not handled, the balloon window
	should never overlap the application window in the pager, so there is
	no real need to do this.

1998-12-09  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* FvwmPager/x_pager.c (SwitchToDeskAndPage):
	(DispatchEvent): patch to make desk changing via button 3 work.
	(MapBalloonWindow): fixed bug #49 (balloon window off-screen)
	I'm a bit concerned because of a possible loop that is mentioned in
	the code when the y offset of the ballon window is zero. This might
	happen now again.

1998-12-08  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* FvwmPager/x_pager.c (Scroll): fixed another mouse-button-3 bug. You

	(DispatchEvent): changed Scroll signature
	(Scroll): Changed signature and removed code limiting movement to 100%
	of the desktop size. What was this good for?

	Moving and releasing the mouse still does not switch desktops.
