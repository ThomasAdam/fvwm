.SH NAME
FvwmPager \- the FVWM Pager module
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBFvwmPager\fP [ \fI-transient\fP ] [ \fIfirst desk\fP [ \fIlast desk\fP ] ]
FvwmPager is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

All desks with desk numbers between \fIfirst desk\fP and \fIlast desk\fP are
displayed. If \fIlast desk\fP is omitted only the \fIfirst desk\fP is shown.
If both desk numbers are omitted, the current desk is used instead. If you
use an asterisk '*' in place of \fIfirst desk\fP the pager will always show
the current desktop, even when you switch desks.

Example lines fo put in your .fvwm2rc:

.nf
.sp
Module FvwmPager 0 3
.sp
.fi
or
.nf
.sp
Module FvwmPager *
.sp
.fi
or from within an fvwm pop-up menu:
.nf
.sp
AddToMenu Module-Popup "Modules"      Title
+                      "Audio"        Module FvwmAudio
+                      "Auto"         Module FvwmAuto 200
+                      "Buttons"      Module FvwmButtons
+                      "Ident"        Module FvwmIdent
+                      "Banner"       Module FvwmBanner
+                      "Pager"        Module FvwmPager 0 3
.sp
.fi
or
.nf
.sp
+                      "Pager"        Module FvwmPager *
.sp
.fi

If the pager is started with the \fI-transient\fP option the mouse pointer
stays within the pager window pointer. The next time a button is released
the pager is closed. Note that this option does only work if the window
style of the pager window is 'sticky' (see fvwm2 man page). You should
use the 'StaysOnTop' style either.

Example:

.nf
.sp
Style FvwmPager Sticky, StaysOnTop
*FvwmPagerRows       1
*FvwmPagerColumns    1
Mouse 3 R C Module FvwmPager -transient
.sp
.fi

With this in your .fvwm2rc, if you press control and button 3 in the root
window the pager pops up under the mouse and while the viewport moves with
the mouse.


.SH DESCRIPTION
The FvwmPager module shows a miniature view of the Fvwm desktops which
are specified in the command line. This is a useful reminder of where
your active windows are. Windows in the pager are shown in the same
color as their fvwm decorations.

The pager can be used to change your viewport into the current
desktop, to change desktops, or to move windows around.

Pressing mouse button 1 in the pager will cause you viewport to
change to the selected page of the selected desk. If you click with
button 1 in the desk-label area, you will switch desks but not
pages within the desk.

Dragging mouse button 2 on a miniature view of a window will cause
that window to be move to the location where you release the mouse
button, but your viewport will not change. If you drag the window
out of the pager and onto your desktop, a full size image of
the window will appear for you to place. There is no way to
pick up a full size image of the window and move it into the pager,
however. Since some mice do not have button 2, I have made provisions to drag
windows in the pager by using pressing modifier-1 (usually Alt) and dragging
with button 3.

Clicking mouse button 3 on a location will cause the viewport to move
to the selected location and switch desks if necessary, but will not
align the viewport to a page boundary. Dragging button 3 will
cause the viewport to move as you drag but not switch desktops, even
if the pointer moves to another desktop.

When iconified, the pager will work as a fully functional current page
only pager. Windows and viewports can be moved within the icon of the
pager. Users will want to make sure that they have no lines similar to
.nf
.sp
Icon "Fvwm Pager" whatever
.sp
.fi
in their .fvwmrc files.


.SH COPYRIGHTS
The FvwmPager program, and the concept for
interfacing this module to the Window Manager, are all original work
by Robert Nation.

Copyright 1994, Robert Nation. No guarantees or warranties or anything
are provided or implied in any way whatsoever. Use this program at your
own risk. Permission to use this program for any purpose is given,
as long as the copyright is kept intact.


.SH INITIALIZATION
During initialization, \fIFvwmPager\fP will eventually search a
configuration file which describes the time-outs and actions to take.
The configuration file is the same file that fvwm used during initialization.

If the FvwmPager executable is linked to another name, ie ln -s
FvwmPager OtherPager, then another module called OtherPager can be
started, with a completely different configuration than FvwmPager,
simply by changing the keyword  FvwmPager to OtherPager. This way multiple
pager programs can be used.

.SH KEYBOARD FOCUS CONTROL
You can direct the keyboard focus to any window on the current desktop
by clicking with button 2 on its image in the pager. The window does
not need to be visible, but it does need to be on the current page.

.SH INVOCATION
The invocation method was shown in the synopsis section

.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
FvwmPager reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm reads when it starts up,
and looks for certain configuration options:

.IP "*FvwmPagerGeometry \fIgeometry\fP"
Completely or partially specifies the pager windows location and
geometry, in standard X11 notation.
In order to maintain an undistorted aspect ratio, you might
want to leave out either the width or height dimension of the
geometry specification

.IP "*FvwmPagerRows \fIrows\fP"
Tells fvwm how many rows of desks to use when laying out the pager
window.

.IP "*FvwmPagerColumns \fIcolumns\fP"
Tells fvwm how many columnss of desks to use when laying out the pager
window.

.IP "*FvwmPagerIconGeometry \fIgeometry\fP"
Specifies a size (optional) and location (optional) for the pager's icon
window. Since there is no easy way for FvwmPager to determine the height of the
icon's label, you will have to make an allowance for the icon  label height
when using negative y-coordinates in the icon location specification (used to
specify a location relative to the bottom instead of the top of the screen).

.IP "*FvwmPagerStartIconic"
Causes the pager to start iconified.

.IP "*FvwmPagerNoStartIconic"
Causes the pager to start normally.  Useful for cancelling the effect
of the \fIStartIconic\fP option.

.IP "*FvwmPagerLabelsBelow"
Causes the pager to draw desk labels below the corresponding desk.

.IP "*FvwmPagerLabelsAbove"
Causes the pager to draw desk labels above the corresponding desk.
Useful for cancelling the effect of the \fILabelsBelow\fP option.

.IP "*FvwmPagerShapeLabels"
Causes the pager to hide the labels of all but the current desk. This
turns off label hilighting.

.IP "*FvwmPagerNoShapeLabels"
Causes the pager to show the labels of all visible desks.
Useful for cancelling the effect of the \fIShapeLabels\fP option.

.IP "*FvwmPagerFont \fIfont-name\fP"
Specified a font to use to label the desktops.  If \fIfont_name\fP is
"none" then no desktop labels will be displayed.

.IP "*FvwmPagerSmallFont \fIfont-name\fP"
Specified a font to use to label the window names in the pager. If not
specified, the window labels will be omitted. Window labels seem to
be fairly useless for desktop scales of 32 or greater.  If \fIfont_name\fP
is "none" then no window names will be displayed.

.IP "*FvwmPagerFore \fIcolor\fP"
Specifies the color to use to write the desktop labels, and
to draw the page-grid lines.

.IP "*FvwmPagerBack \fIcolor\fP"
Specifies the background color for the window.

.IP "*FvwmPagerHilight \fIcolor\fP"
The active page and desk label will be highlighted by using this
background pattern instead of the normal background.

.IP "*FvwmPagerHilightPixmap \fIpixmap\fP"
The active page will be highlighted by using this background pattern
instead of the normal background.

.IP "*FvwmPagerDeskHilight"
Hilight the active page with the current hilight color/pixmap. Useful
for cancelling the effect of the \fINoDeskHilight\fP option.

.IP "*FvwmPagerNoDeskHilight"
Don't hilight the active page.

.IP "*FvwmPagerWindowColors \fIfore back hiFore hiBack\fP"
Change the normal/highlight colors of the windows. \fIfore\fP and
\fIhiFore\fP specify the colors as used for the font inside the windows.
\fIback\fP and \fIhiBack\fP are used to fill the windows with.

.IP "*FvwmPagerWindowLabelFormat \fIformat\fP"
This specifies a printf() like format for the labels in the mini window.
Possible flags are: %t, %i, %c, and %r for the window's title, icon, class,
or resource name, respectively.  The default is "%i".

.IP "*FvwmPagerLabel \fIdesk label\fP"
Assigns the text \fIlabel\fP to desk \fIdesk\fP (or the current desk
if desk is "*") in the pager window. Useful for assigning symbolic names
to desktops, i.e.
.nf
.sp
*FvwmPagerLabel 1 Mail
*FvwmPagerLabel 2 Maker
*FvwmPagerLabel * Matlab
.sp
.fi

.IP "*FvwmPagerDeskColor \fIdesk color\fP"
Assigns the color \fIcolor\fP to desk \fIdesk\fP (or the current desk if
desk is "*") in the pager window. This replaces the background color for
the particular \fIdesk\fP.  This only works when the pager is full sized.
When Iconified, the pager uses the color specified by *FvwmPagerBack.
.sp
\fBTIP:\fP	Try using *FvwmPagerDeskColor in conjunction with
FvwmCpp (or FvwmM4) and FvwmBacker to assign identical
colors to your various desktops and the pager representations.

.IP "*FvwmPagerPixmap \fIpixmap\fP"
Use \fIpixmap\fP as background for the pager.

.IP "*FvwmPagerDeskPixmap \fIdesk pixmap\fP"
Assigns the pixmap \fIcolor\fP to desk \fIdesk\fP (or the current desk if
desk is "*") in the pager window. This replaces the background pixmap for
the particular \fIdesk\fP.
.sp
\fBTIP:\fP Try using *FvwmPagerDeskPixmap in conjunction with FvwmCpp
(or FvwmM4) and FvwmBacker to assign identical pixmaps to your various
desktops and the pager representations.

.IP "*FvwmPagerDeskTopScale \fInumber\fP"
If the geometry is not specified, then a desktop reduction factor is
used to calculate the pager's size. Things in the pager window
are shown at 1/\fInumber\fP of the actual size.

.IP "*FvwmPagerMiniIcons"
Allow the pager to display a window's mini icon in the pager, if it has
one, instead of showing the window's name.

.IP "*FvwmPagerBalloons [\fItype\fP]"
Show a balloon describing the window when the pointer is moved into
a window in the pager. Currently only the window's icon name is shown.
If \fItype\fP is \fIPager\fP balloons are just shown for an uniconified
pager; if \fItype\fP is \fIIcon\fP balloons are just shown for an
iconified pager. If \fItype\fP is anything else (or null) balloons are
always shown.

.IP "*FvwmPagerBalloonFore \fIcolor\fP"
Specifies the color for text in the balloon window. If omitted it
defaults to the foreground color for the window being described.

.IP "*FvwmPagerBalloonBack \fIcolor\fP"
Specifies the background color for the balloon window. If omitted it
defaults to the background color for the window being described.

.IP "*FvwmPagerBalloonFont \fIfont-name\fP"
Specifies a font to use for the balloon text. Defaults to \fIfixed\fP.

.IP "*FvwmPagerBalloonBorderWidth \fInumber\fP"
Sets the width of the balloon window's border. Defaults to 1.

.IP "*FvwmPagerBalloonBorderColor \fIcolor\fP"
Sets the color of the balloon window's border. Defaults to black.

.IP "*FvwmPagerBalloonYOffset \fInumber\fP"
The balloon window is positioned to be horizontally centered against
the pager window it is describing. The vertical position may be
set as an offset. Negative offsets of \fI-n\fP are placed \fIn\fP
pixels above the pager window, positive offsets of \fI+n\fP are placed
\fIn\fP pixels below. Offsets of 0 are not permitted, as this would permit
direct transit from pager window to balloon window, causing an event
loop. Defaults to +2. The offset will change sign automatically, as needed,
to keep the balloon on the screen.

.IP "*FvwmPagerBalloonStringFormat \fTformat\fP"
The same as \fI*FvwmPagerWindowLabelFormat\fP, it just specifies the string to
display in the balloons.
