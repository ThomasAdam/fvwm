.SH NAME
FvwmM4 \- the FVWM  M4 pre-processor
.SH SYNOPSIS
FvwmM4 is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

.SH DESCRIPTION
When called, this module will attempt to have M4 pre-process the file
specified in its invocation, and then have fvwm read the resulting file.

.SH INVOCATION
FvwmM4 can be invoked by inserting the line 'FvwmM4' in
the .fvwm2rc file. It can also be called from a menu or mouse binding.
If the user wants his entire .fvwm2rc file pre-processed with FvwmM4,
then fvwm should be invoked as:

.EX
fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc"
.EE

Note that the argument to the option "-cmd" should be enclosed
in quotes, and no other quoting should be used. For example, a
typical invocation might be:

.EX
fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 -m4-squote { -m4-equote } .fvwm2rc"
.EE

Some options can be specified on the command line:
.IP -m4-prefix
I think this makes all the m4 directives require the prefix "m4_".

.IP -m4-prefix-defines
Causes built-in defines to be prefixed with "m4_" (i.e., m4_HOME
is defined instead of HOME, etc.)

.TP
-m4opt \fIoption\fP
Lets you pass an option to the m4 program.  Not really needed as any
unknown options will be passed on automatically.

.TP
-m4-squote \fIcharacter\fP
Lets you change the m4 start-of-quote character to \fIcharacter\fP.

.TP
-m4-equote \fIcharacter\fP
Lets you change the m4 end-of-quote character to \fIcharacter\fP.

.TP
-m4prog \fIname\fP
Instead of invoking "m4", fvwm will invoke \fIname\fP.

.TP
-outfile \fIfilename\fP
Instead of creating a random unique name for the temporary file for
the preprocessed rc file, this option will let you specify the name of
the temporary file it will create.  Please note that FvwmM4 will attempt
to remove this file before writing to it, so don't point it at anything
important even if it has read-only protection.

.IP -debug
Causes the temporary file create by m4 to
be retained. This file is usually called "/tmp/fvwmrcXXXXXX"

.IP -lock
If you want to use this option you need to start FvwmM4 with 
ModuleSynchronous. This option causes fvwm to wait that the pre-process
finish and that FvwmM4 asks fvwm to Read the pre-processed file before 
continuing. This may be useful at startup if you use a session manager 
as Gnome. Also, this is useful if you want to process and run a Form in 
a fvwm function.

.IP -noread
Causes the pre-processed file to be not read by fvwm. Useful to
pre-process a FvwmScript script with FvwmM4.


.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
FvwmM4 defines some values for use in the pre-processor file:

.IP TWM_TYPE
Always set to "fvwm".
.IP SERVERHOST
The name of the machine running the X Server.
.IP CLIENTHOST

The X server vendor.
.IP RELEASE
The X server release number.
.IP SCREEN
The screen number.
.IP WIDTH
The screen width in pixels.
.IP HEIGHT
The screen height in pixels.
.IP X_RESOLUTION
Some distance/pixel measurement for the horizontal direction, I think.
.IP Y_RESOLUTION

configure.h at compile time.
.IP FVWM_MODULEDIR
The directory where fvwm looks for .fvwmrc and modules by default, as
determined at compile time.
.IP FVWM_USERDIR

FvwmM4 is the result of a random bit mutation on a hard disk,
presumably a result of a  cosmic-ray or some such thing.
