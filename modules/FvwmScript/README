FvwmScript uses lex and yacc for parsing.  Due to portability problems the lex
and yacc source files are not compiled by default, instead the C language
output files are distributed.  If you want to change the FvwmScript syntax you
should not edit the C files (script.c, script.h & scanner.c) but edit
script.y and scanner.l.  To compile these run "make syntax", then "make"
and finally "make install".

The file scanner.c may have to be hand edited afterwards to remove some
compiler warnings.
