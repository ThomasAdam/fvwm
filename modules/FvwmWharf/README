This is a port of the AfterStep
wharf module to an fvwm2 module.

You should install this directory
in the modules subdirectory of the
fvwm source directory.

I have only build this on a SUN
running solaris 2.

I don't think it will build if you enable the
audio extensions. It should build but I have
no idea if it works if you enable the
drag and drop extenstions. I am not sure
if all the textures work. Swallow does seem
to work.

I am happy to attempt to maintain this.
If you find/fix any bugs or fox the
man page,
