	* Parse.c (PeekArgument): malloc -> safemalloc

1998-11-24  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* Parse.h (LFindToken):  Remove this macro.  It's not used, and it
	uses a 	non-standard function lfind().  Best to not use it at all.
	(search.h): Removed #include.

	* FvwmEvent.c  (config):   Fix logic on  test   for  cmd  needs  a
 	parameter.  Thes test for "table != e" was incorrect.  Only try to
 	strip off trailing newline when there is a newline on the command.
  	It was stripping the  last  character when  commands came in  from
 	FvwmTalk.
