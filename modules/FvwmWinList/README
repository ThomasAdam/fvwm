If you have read the a previous README on this, you may want to skip to the
CHANGELOG.  This file is very familiar to the last README.

Well, here is a summary of what it will do (* = new):
  - All memory in managed dynamically by linked lists, keeping in the spirit
    of Fvwm to use as little memory as possible.
  - Display all windows that Fvwm knows about in Fvwm style buttons
  - Iconifying a window will place () around its name in the list
  - Can be nicely shutdown by typing 'Q' or 'q' inside the window
  - FvwmWinListGeometry {+-}<x>{+-}x   (size is ignored)
  - FvwmWinListAction <action> <response>
       Only Click1, Click2, Click3 are allowed as actions right now
       Responses can be any Fvwm built in, or a comma seperated list of such.
         (ie: '*FvwmWinListAction Click1 Iconify -1, Raise' will deiconify the
          window and then raise it)
       Click1 defaults to 'Iconify -1, Raise'
       Click2 defaults to 'Iconify'
       Click3 defaults to 'Lower'
       (See config.sample for an example)
  - FvwmWinListUseSkipList 
       Will not show the windows listed with a 'WindowListSkip' style.
  - FvwmWinListNoAnchor
       FvwmWinList will, by default, anchor the corner which has gravity, use
       this to undo it.  (btw, NW gravity and NoAnchor provide the same result.
       (+x+y=NorthWest,+x-y=SouthWest,-x+y=NorthEast,-x-y=SouthEast)
       This is so you can place the window list in the lower corners and
       the list will not wrap past the screen edge.
  - FvwmWinListUseIconNames
       As it says, it will use the icon names instead of using the window
       names.  People have mentioned that some window names become to long.
  - Allowed FvwmWinList to be started up with an arguemnt 'Transient' to allow
       it to work like the build in window list.  Right now if you use it in
       transient mode it will only execute the command for Click1.  Looking
       for suggestions about using other buttons.  Was considering using
       modifiers (ie. Shift means button 2, etc)
  - FvwmWinList now uses MWMDecorHints.  (Makes the 'Transient' mode look good)
  - Buttons now stay down until you actually release the button.  You can click
       and hold the button down and move across the buttons and the will go up
       and down as to enter leave the area.  Actions are performed on button
       release and not on press.
  - FvwmWinList will unmap itself if it has no windows to display and will
       remap itself when a new window it can display is opened.  If there
       are no windows to display and you are using it in transient mode, it
       will not come up.

I have only run this under Linux on my 386/40 with 8megs, please let me know
if you experience problems with compiling, running, or performance.  I want
to tune it to run as efficient as possible, later in life.

Now, the things I still want to do with it.  If you have suggestions, please
send them to me, want to make this as useful as possible.

To do: (in no particular order)
 - Add the following configurable options:
   - FvwmWinlistAction <action> <response>
       Add more actions, like press, release, motion, 2x click, slide, etc.,
         instead of just Click<x>
   - FvwmWinlistOrientaion (down|across)
       Should the buttons be a vertical or a horizontal list
   - FvwmWinlistMaxWidth <x> 
       Where x is the max pixel width of the window.
   - FvwmWinlistTooLong (wrap|truncate|initials)
       What to do if the names are too long.  (assuming you set MaxWidth)
 - Allow the user to setup what is in the Op's and Detail's menu
 - Possible allow diffent fonts/colors for submenus.
 - Rob mentioned some people would like icons in the list if the window
     if iconified.  I personally like the (), although  I am a but biased.
     Let me know what you think/want, I will try.
 - Place a small 3-D pixmap/bitmap next-to/around the windows that are
     iconified instead of the ().
 - Like to allow resizing of the window and have the buttons match the window
     (ie.  You make it wider you get 2 columns of buttons, etc.)

 - Fix the following:
   - The function saferealloc, based on safemalloc by Rob Nation still doesn't
     work correctly, I left it in the Mallocs.c file but I use the normal
     realloc now.  (Being lazy on this one)
   - Make compile compatability for all systems
   - Tune FvwmWinList to be more efficient  (Low priority, right now)

I am open to, actually I am trolling for, suggestions/improvments/ideas/rags
on this.

Here is a list of files included in the tar file:

ButtonArray.c
ButtonArray.h
CHANGELOG
Colors.c
Colors.h
FvwmWinList.README
FvwmWinList.c
FvwmWinList.h
Imakefile
List.c
List.h
Mallocs.c
Mallocs.h
config.sample
wild.c

You can unpack it by:

cd /foo/fvwm/modules
gzip -dc FvwmWinList-0.1.tar.gz | tar xf -

That will unpack the source into /foo/fvwm/modules/FvwmWinList.


If you want a binary distribution or diffs, let me know.
