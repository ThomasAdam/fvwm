March 21st, 1994: (All the patches should have been fixed/replaced by new mods)
  - Changed <sys/varags.h> to <varargs.h>
  - Added <ctype.h> to Mallocs.c
  - Fonts now work.  (Stupid me)
  - Added options:
    *FvwmWinListGeometry {+-}<x>{+-}x   (size is ignored)
    *FvwmWinListAction <action> <response>
       Only Click1, Click2, Click3 are allowed as actions right now
       Responses can be any Fvwm built in, or a comma seperated list of such.
         (ie: '*FvwmWinListAction Click1 Iconify -1, Raise' will deiconify the
          window and then raise it)
       Click1 defaults to 'Iconify -1, Raise'
       Click2 defaults to 'Iconify'
       Click3 defaults to 'Lower'
       (See config.sample for an example)
    *FvwmWinListUseSkipList 
       Will not show the windows listed in a 'WindowListSkip' line.
    *FvwmWinListNoAnchor
       FvwmWinList will, by default, anchor the corner which has gravity, use
       this to undo it.  (btw, NW gravity and NoAnchor provide the same result.
       (+x+y=NorthWest,+x-y=SouthWest,-x+y=NorthEast,-x-y=SouthEast)
       This is so you can place the window list in the lower corners and
       the list will not wrap past the screen edge.

March 25st, 1994: (The patch should have be fixed/replaced by new mods)
  - FvwmWinListUseIconNames
       As it says, it will use the icon names instead of using the window
       names.  People have mentioned that some window names become to long.
  - FvwmWinList now skips windows if the name in the WindowListSkip line
       matches the windows name, icon name, resource name, or resource class.
       (This is the same way the built-in fvwm window list works)
  - Changed some code so it doesn't redraw the window so often.
  - Added man page.

April 5th, 1994: (Patches should be overtaken by this release)
  - Allowed FvwmWinList to be started up with an arguemnt 'Transient' to allow
       it to work like the build in window list.  Right now if you use it in
       transient mode it will only execute the command for Click1.  Looking
       for suggestions about using other buttons.  Was considering using
       modifiers (ie. Shift means button 2, etc)
  - FvwmWinList now uses MWMDecorHints.  (Makes the 'Transient' mode look good)
  - Buttons now stay down until you actually release the button.  You can click
       and hold the button down and move across the buttons and the will go up
       and down as to enter leave the area.  Actions are performed on button
       release and not on press.
  - FvwmWinList will unmap itself if it has no windows to display and will
       remap itself when a new window it can display is opened.  If there
       are no windows to display and you are using it in transient mode, it
       will not come up.

April 16th, 1994:
  - Patched to use the new style way of WindowSkipList
  - Cleaned up some definitions

May 8th, 1994: This patch replaces the April 16th patch
  - Re-did the patch because of bad hunk.
  - Added strcasecmp for those who have 'NEED_STRCASECMP' defined.
  - Fixed WinList drifting problem with BorderWidth of 0

May 9th, 1994:
  - Removed support for the old style of WindowSkipList, you must use Styles.
  - Hopefully, the above will speed up processing of the list from fvwm and
    it will not hang.  Please let me know if you still have problems, you
    might.

May, 1996:
 * Modifications by Don Mahurin, May 1996
 * Modifications Done to Add Title Icon support, focus highlighting and
   Current Desk Only Option
 * Some of this Code was taken from FvwmTaskBar

 * Bug Notes:(Don Mahurin)

 * Moving a window doesnt send M_CONFIGURE, as I thought it should. Desktop
 * for that button is not updated.(So if FvwmWinListShowCurrentWindow is set
 *  moving a window does not move it on the WinList

 * There seems to be something incosistant about Resizing and the value given
 * back as win_x, win_y with fvwm.  SEE RESIZE_BUG_HACK in the code for my work
 * around.  Ok, Ill tell you about it:
	XMoveResizeWindow sometimes assumes the x,y you pass it includes the
	border width, other times it doesnt.  Specific to the program, When I
	am only opening closing/minimizing Windows in the same desktop, borders
	have to be added when adjusting.  But when I Adjust the window when
        changing Desktops, 
	I have to remove the border width( and a fudge factor).
