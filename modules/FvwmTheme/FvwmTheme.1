.SH NAME
FvwmTheme \- an FVWM modules for managing the appearance of FVWM and its modules

.SH SYNOPSIS
FvwmTheme is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

.SH COPYRIGHT
Copyright (C) 1999 Joey Shutup.  No guarantees or warranties or anything are

Permission to use this program for any purpose is given, as long as the
copyright is kept intact.

.SH DESCRIPTION
FvwmTheme creates appearance resources that may be shared by FVWM and other
modules.  It reads an initial configuration and also reacts to configuration
commands and mesages sent from FVWM so that the resources can be dynamically
changed.

.SH INVOCATION
FvwmTheme must be spawned as a module by fvwm.
.PP
It is important that FvwmTheme is invoked before any other modules
that use the color sets provided by FvwmTheme.  Thus FvwmTheme has
to be invoked with the 'ModuleSynchronous' command by inserting the
line 'ModuleSynchronous Timeout 10 FvwmTheme' in the .fvwm2rc file.
This can be placed on a line by itself, if FvwmTheme is to be
spawned during fvwm's initialization.  It can be started from fvwm's
StartFunction too and should then be the first command executed.
Invoking FvwmTheme later may not work properly
and can cause excessive redrawind of already running modules.
Fvwm will search the directory specified in the ModulePath
configuration option to attempt to locate FvwmTheme. It is pointless
to run more than one FvwmTheme so there is no provision for using an
alias name.

.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
FvwmTheme supports some configuration options.

.IP "*FvwmThemeColorset \fIn\fP \fIoptions\fP "
Will create or modify colorset \fIn\fP. Each colorset has a four colors, an
optional pixmap and an optional shape mask. The four colors are used by modules
as the foreground. background, highlight and shadow colors.  When a colorset is 
created the colors from colorset 0 are copied (these are also controlled by
the DefaultColors fvwm command).

\fIoptions\fP is a coma separated list containing some of the keywords: fg,
fore, foreground, bg, back, background, hi, hilite, hilight, sh, shade, shadow,
pixmap, pixmap, tiledpixmap, aspectpixmap, shape, tiledshape and ?gradient.

\fIfg\fP, \fIfore\fP and \fIforeground\fP take a color name as an argument and
set the foreground color.  The special name \fIconstrast\fP may be used to
select a color that contrasts well with the background color.

\fIbg\fP, \fIback\fP and \fIbackground\fP take a color name as an argument and
set the background color.  It also sets the highlight and shadow colors to
values that give a 3d effect. The special name \fIaverage\fP may be used to
select a color that is the average color of the pixmap.

\fIhi\fP, \fIhilite\fP and \fIhilight\fP take a color name as as argument and
set the highlight color. This is overwritten whenever the background color is
changed.

\fIsh\fP, \fIshade\fP and \fIshadow\fP take a color name as as argument and
set the shadow color. This is overwritten whenever the background color is
changed.

\fIpixmap\fP, \fItiledpixmap\fP and \fIaspectpixmap\fP take a file name as
an argument, search the \fIImagePath\fP and use it as the background pixmap.
Any transparent parts are filled with the background color. Not specifying a
file name removes any existing one from the colorset. \fItiledpixmap\fP will
produce repeated copies of the image with no scaling, \fIpixmap\fP will
cause the image to be stretched to fit whatever object the colorset is applied
to and \fIascpectpixmap\fP will stretch to fit but will retain the image
aspect ratio. Bitmaps are not supported (why not? it could use the hi,sh colors)

\fIshape\fP, \fItiledshape\fP and \fIaspectshape\fP take a file name as
an argument, search the \fIImagePath\fP and use it as the shape bitmap.
\fItiledshape\fP will produce repeated copies of the bitmap with no scaling,
\fIshape\fP will cause the bitmap to be stretched to fit whatever object the
colorset is applied to and \fIascpectshape\fP will stretch to fit but will
retain the bitmap aspect ratio. Pixmaps are not supported (or are they?????)

Warning: Due to the way X11 implements shapes and the implementation
of the FvwmTheme module you cannot take back making windows shaped.
You may have to restart fvwm or the shaped application.

\fI?gradient ...\fP will create a pixmap and stretch it to fit the window.
\fI?gradient\fP may be one of Hgradient, Vgradient, Dgradient, Bgradient,
Sgradient, Cgradient, Rgradient or Ygradient.  The gradient types are as
follows:  H is horizontal; V is vertical; D is diagonal from top left to
bottom right; B is a backwards diagonal from bottom left to top right; S
is concentric squares; C is con-centric circles; R is a radar like pattern
and Y is a Yin Yang style (but without the dots, we are not \fIthat\fP sad).
Please refer to the \fICOLOR GRADIENTS\fP section in the \fIfvwm2\fP man page
for the syntax of gradients.

.IP "*FvwmThemeReadWriteColors"
Tells FvwmTheme to use read/write color cells for the foreground and background
pixels. This can make changing colorsets much faster but can only be used with
PseudoColor displays. This option must be specified first and it cannot be
turned off. If the pixmap and shape of a colorset are unchanged modules
do not redraw when the colors are changed.

.SH COMMANDS
The following FVWM command may be executed at any time to alter the colorsets.
It may be bound to a menu item or typed into a module such as FvwmTalk.

.IP "SendToModule FvwmTheme Colorset \fIoptions\fP"
The syntax is the same as the configuration option.

.SH EXAMPLES

  *FvwmThemeColorset 3 fg wheat, bg navy

If necessary this will create colorsets 0, 1, 2 and 3 and then change colorset
3 to have a foreground of wheat, a background of navy.

  *FvwmThemeColorset 3 bg "navy blue"

Will change the background color of colorset 3 to navy blue. The foreground and
pixmap will be unchanged.

  *FvwmThemeColorset 3 aspectpixmap large_murky_dungeon.xpm

Will cause depression

  *FvwmThemeColorset 3 bg average

Will set the backgriund color and the relief colors to match the background
pixmap.

  *FvwmThemeColorset 3 Ygradient 200 3 blue 1000 navy 1 blue 1000 navy

Will add a Yin Yang gradient background pixmap to colorset 3.  If the
background is set to average it will be recomputed as will the foreground
if that is set to contrast.

  #!/bin/sh
  FvwmCommand "SendToModule FvwmTheme Colorset 7 fg navy, bg gray"
  while true
  do
    FvwmCommand "SendToModule FvwmTheme Colorset 7 fg gray"
    sleep 1
    FvwmCommand "SendToModule FvwmTheme Colorset 7 fg navy"
    sleep 1
  done

will make colorset 7 blink if used with the *FvwmThemeReadWriteColors option.
