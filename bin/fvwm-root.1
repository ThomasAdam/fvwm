.SH NAME
fvwm-root \- Sets the root window of the current X display to image

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fvwm-root
.RB [ \-d ]
.RB [ \-fe ]
.I image_file

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I fvwm-root
reads the image file specified in the command line and displays it in the
root window.  The supported image formats are
.IR XBM ", " XPM " and " PNG
if appropriated libraries are compiled in.

.SH OPTIONS
These command line options are recognized by fvwm-root:
.TP
.BI "-d"
Causes fvwm-root NOT to set the background, but to free a memory
associated with the _XSETROOT_ID property (if any).
In any case the _XSETROOT_ID property is set to None and some programs,
like FVWM modules, may use this to update their background if the background
is transparent.
.TP
.BI "-fe"
Causes fvwm-root to free the memory associated with the ESETROOT_PMAP_ID
property. This is useful if you  alternately use fvwm-root and an
Esetroot compatible program.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
In the past this utility was called
.IR xpmroot .
This name is still supported as a symlink.

.SH BUGS
Repeated use of fvwm-root with different xpm pixmaps will use up slots in
your color table pretty darn fast.
