  transients of a window are lowered when the window itself is lowered
  (default) or not.

* There can be two mini icons per menu label instead of one now.

  with the ItemFormat option for the MenuStyle command. The width of the
  borders around menus and hilighted items can be controlled with the
  options BorderWidth and Hilight3DThickness (MenuStyle). Menu behavior can
  be mirrored with the SumbenusLeft option (hard to describe, it's best to

  two are left aligned, the third is right aligned by default.

  becomes a move. It works in FvwmPager too.

* New style IconOverride/NoIconOverride/NoActiveIconOverride to
  influence the overriding behaviour of the Icon style.

* The FvwmCommand module is now much faster and can thus comfortably be used in
  shell scripts. The tradeoff is that it does not report errors any more. To
  get the old behaviour run FvwmCommand with the '-i 1' option.

* Dynamic menus are provided by the special menu items 'DynamicPopupAction' and
  'DynamicPopdownAction'. See the man page on 'AddToMenu' for details.

* System-wide config files are now in ${sysconfdir}/fvwm
  (i.e. /usr/local/etc/fvwm by default) as many files are now installed there.

* New button style flag MWMDecorShade to support toggle buttons for shaded
  windows.

* Daily snapshots of the development sources available on our web page.

* FixedPosition style: disables moving the window.

* IgnoreRestack style: forbids clients to change their own stacking
  order position.

* The NoWarp option to the Focus command for focusing window on a different
  page without switching to that page.

* Fvwm raises icon titles when the pointer is over the icon.

* The cursors used for the pan frames at the edge of the screen can be changed.

* StaysOnBottom style.

* ResizeHintOverride style: a window with this style can be resized beyond the
  program supplied minimum and maximum size. This is a hack to make fvwm
  cooperate with broken applications.

* NeverFocus style: windows with this style never receive the focus.

* New command: DefaultIcon to set the default icon.

* New command line arguments -visual and -visualId.

* GrabFocusTransient is a new style that does the same as GrabFocus, but only
  for transient windows.

Changes in alpha release 2.3.0 (February 1999)

* FvwmPipe and FvwmConfig modules have been removed.

* New command: RecaptureWindow captures a single window.

* 'GotoDesk' command replaces former command 'Desk' (the old name is still
  supported.

* 'Restart fvwm2' preserves almost all per-window using the file
  $FVWM_USERHOME/.fvwm_restart.

* #define PICK_TRUECOLOR will make fvwm use the best TrueColor Visual.  This is
  for those poor unfortunates with legacy apps that crash if the default visual
  is not an 8 bit PseudoColor (but fortunate enough to have a 24 bit server
  that supports both 8 bit and 24 bit TrueColor)

* New command line argument -replace. fvwm will try to "take over"
  from a running wm only if it is given.

* ImagePath and ModulePath commands now expand '+' to be the
  previous value of the path.

* Key and mouse bindings take effect immediately. A 'Recapture' was necessary
  before this change.

* Unmaximizing keeps windows on the same page.

* Maximize can now expand until some other window is found to fully utilize
  available screen space.

* Use the 'GrabFocusOff' style to prevent ClickToFocus windows taking the focus
  from other ClickToFocus windows when they are mapped the first time. The
  opposite option is called 'GrabFocus' and can be used in conjunction with
  MouseFocus and SloppyFocus too.

* New command IgnoreModifiers for ignoring the pesky num-lock key with
  key and mouse bindings.  Hint: try this command with XFree86:

    IgnoreModifiers L25

  If you encounter performance problems please consult the manpage and the FAQ.

* Enhancements to MoveToPage and GotoPage: 'prev' option to refer to the last
  visited page, negative numbers refer to lower/right page, suffix 'p'
  indicates page number relative to current page.

* Mailcheck interval option for FvwmTaskBar.

* Colorlimit command does nothing if display depth is greater than 20.
  This helps if you want to use the same configuration on more than one
  display depth.  ColorLimit defaults to ON if display depth is 8 bits
  or less.  This should help new users.

* Maximize can now expand until some other window is found to fully utilize
  available screen space.

* FvwmWinList option *FvwmWinListFollowWindowList to display the order that
  fvwm keeps windows in. You can now see the order that Next/Prev will take,
  Prev goes down the list, Next goes up (from the bottom).

* WindowID command now takes conditions like Current.

* Improved cursor support: CursorStyle now supports changing
  cursor colors and creating cursors from xpm files.

* New style options: StartsLowered, StartsRaised.

* New function PlaceAgain: moves a window to where it would be placed.

* New module FvwmGtk. It implements menus, dialogs and window-lists
  using the GTK toolkit.

* NoInset is independent from HiddenHandles, it now works on NoHandles style
  windows.

* Made FvwmPager a bit simpler. Added -transient options to bind a transient
  pager to mouse buttons (see FvwmPager man page for an example).

* VMS port; see vms/README for details.

* New MenuStyle options: PopupAsRootmenu, PopupAsSubmenu

* The 'extras' directory has been merged into 'modules'; the
  --enable-extras configure flag is obsolete.

* New command: Silent. Suppresses user interaction when a window is needed but
  none is selected.

* New utility xselection which can be used with PipeRead to feed the
  content of the X Selection as commands to fvwm.

* Fvwm can now "take over" from a running (ICCCM 2 compliant) wm.

* FvwmPager can now handle pixmaps as desk backgrounds.

* Layer information is displayed in WindowList.

* Animated window shading.

* Shaded windows can be resized.

* Windows can be shaded and maximized.

* Fonts and colors are no longer hard-coded on the FvwmAnimate customization
  form.  FvwmForm can set defaults that the FvwmAnimate form will use.

* New commands All and Pick.

* New command XORPixmap for increased visibility of the rubber band lines and
  general spangly-ness.

* New start up sequence: all start up scripts etc. are read before the initial
  capture so windows styles will be correct, no need for a recapture.

* EdgeThickness can resize/hide/show panframes in mid function.

* Support for transparent Eterms etc. during opaque/animated moves.

* FvwmPager tracks windows during opaque/animated moves.

* Session management. Fvwm talks to a session manager
  and saves and restores its state.

* Layers. New commands Layer, DefaultLayers; new Style
  option, WindowList option and condition Layer.

* Lots of changes to FvwmForm:
  No limits of form size.
  Fonts and colors can change anywhere in the form.
  Form appearance can be configured globaly:
    Form defaults are read from .FvwmForm.
    There is a built in Default setting/saving dialogue.
  Forms can be read in directly from a file.
  Some forms are installed automatically.
  Tab to previous field.
  You can control vertical spacing on text so spacing is OK for help panels.
  A button can execute a synchronous shell command.
  You can paste into a form
  Forms can read configuration data.

* IconPath and PixmapPath are replaced by single ImagePath.  All
  images, no matter what their format are searched for along the
  ImagePath.

  PrepopMenusOff to PopupDelayed.

Changes in beta release 2.1.8 (January 1999)

* New options SidePic and SideColor to MenuStyle

  MoveToDesk command, which uses an argument syntax identical to the
  enhanced Desk command, and allows constraining a move within a range
  of desks.

Changes in beta release 2.1.4 (December 1998)

* Fvwm creates an environment variable FVWM_MODULEDIR containing the path
  to the default module directory, for use in config files, etc.

* Improved menu handling: Menu position hints, individual menu styles,
  cursor key navigation, animated menus :-)
* Improved window movement: AnimatedMove, SetAnimation, SnapAttraction
  (like in KDE), move/resize can be aborted with a mouse button, Warp option
  to Move/AnimatedMove.
* Direction command (allows to switch windows via cursor (or other) keys in an
  intuitive way).
* Recapture command is now faster.
* Startup is a bit faster if you have a large configuration file and
  a high ClickTime.

* Improved Shadow/Hilite algorithm (from scwm).  Logic moved into
  library and all modules with 3D logic now use this routine.
* SnapAttraction Command: If during an interactive move a window comes
  within a certain distance in pixels of another it will be moved to
  make the borders adjoin.
* ...MenuStyle commands: allow to name different menu styles and apply them
  to individual menus.
* Direction command

Changes in alpha release 2.1.1 (October 1998)

* Official home page html added to docs directory.

Changes in alpha release 2.1.0 (October 1998)

* basic autoconfiguration support; see INSTALL.fvwm and INSTALL
* modules installed into ${libexecdir}/fvwm/${VERSION}
  - since the version string is encoded into the module directory, it
    is safer to rely on the compiled-in ModulePath, rather than
    setting it yourself in .fvwm2rc
* system configure (system.fvwm2rc) searched for in ${sysconfdir}
* FvwmCpp and FvwmM4 no longer define FVWMDIR variable; instead they
  define FVWM_MODULEDIR and FVWM_CONFIGDIR

        3. Added SetEnv function (also from Greg's patch)
        4. Fixed some memory leaks
        5. Cleaned up some ugly code pointed out by Peter Seebach
           (like mystrcasecmp & mystrncasecmp - are these even needed
           anyways?  Is there any system that doesn't have the non-"my"
           versions?)
        6. Builtin WindowList no longer searches for xpm's in window
           titles (patch from Greg Badros)
        7. Various compiler fixes
        8. Created textures directory, put Martin Cartwright's

            always said that is the proper syntax)
        13. Fixed some minor parsing bugs
        14. Added check to GetWindowSizeHints to compensate for bad

	    building executables to fix problem where run-time load path
	    wouldn't be set correctly on solaris.
	28. Added Albrecht Kadlec's SetupModule() routine to fvwmlib.
	29. Integrated MouseFocusOnStartup patch.
	30. Put my fvwm configuration in sample.fvwm/BradyMontz.

2.0.46

Aug 20, 1997

Version 2.0.46 is now available, at long last...  Doesn't have all of
the stuff that I wanted to get in there, but it was taking WAY too
long for me to put it together, so the rest will have to wait until
2.0.47.  Namely, if you were looking for the animated menus patch or
the colorlimiting patch, some variation of each of those will most
likely appear in 2.0.47.  The march towards 2.1.0 continues...

Also, PLEASE be sure to read the ChangeLog entries each time you
upgrade to make sure you don't miss anything that might require you to
change something in your .fvwm2rc, etc.

       1. Patch to remove forgotten CLICKTORAISE #if check, from
          Markus Gutschke
       2. More mini xpm files
       3. Fix to XTerm font change problem
       4. There is no 4...
       5. Updated extras/FvwmScript from Frederic Cordier
       6. Changing default XORValue to 0, which now means "try and
          guess what a good XORValue is for my display" (using recommended
          method in the XLib Programming Manual)
       7. Updated FvwmM4 & Cpp man pages to show correct invocation...
       8. Updated extras/fvwmperl from Dan Astoorian
       9. FAQ updates
       10. Imakefile fixes
       11. Added info to FvwmIdent (transient)
       12. Brought back 1.xx like CursorStyle command (based on old
           patch from Kit Smithers)
       13. Patch from Patrice Fortier to allow xpm backgrounds in
           FvwmButtons (noticed some problems with this)
       14. Updated FvwmCommand from Toshi Isogai
       15. Builtin WinList fixes (geometry string makes more sense now,
           plus alphabetic sort option from Eric Schott)
       16. Fix from Andrew for NoButton 0 problem
       17. GetDecor SCO CPP patch from Andrew
       18. Patch from Andrew for MWM buttons functions problems
       19. Fix from Dave Goldberg for NoTitle & MiniIcon conflict
       20. Move/Resize frame drawing bug patch from Makoto Matsushita
       21. Patch to FlipFocus (under MouseFocus) from Markus Gutschke
       22. Added patch from Rob Whapham/Thimo Jansen for FvwmPager
           miniicons (plus small enhancements)
       23. FvwmBacker patch from Tim Phipps to have it run fvwm
           commands instead of unix commands, so borders & the like
           can be changed too (just use Exec to get old functionality)
       24. Latest FvwmIconMan (v1.0) from Brady Montz
       25. Fix for static buffer overflow in SendDataToModule in read.c
           (when IconPath/PixmapPath greater than 255 chars)
       26. Patch from Tim Phipps to add Current op (like Prev & Next,
           but operates only on Current window) and enhanced conditionals
           for Prev/Next/Current/None (like the addition of !<name>)
       27. Added FvwmWharf to extras dir (ported from AfterStep by Peter Gray)
       28. Added FvwmTaskBar to extras dir (ported from fvwm95 by Don Mahurin)
       29. Added FvwmWinList miniicons patch from Don Mahurin.  Still
           need to update docs for it...
       30. Patches from Randy Ray to make windowshade module packets
           more "standard" & add filename to MINI_ICON packet
       31. Patch from Barry Warsaw to make multi head code work
           slightly better (although it probably needs a total rewrite
           to really work well - ctwm good model?)
       32. Patch to echo builtin needs to remove final \n if there is
           one (Greg Badros sees this, but I don't so it might be a system
           dependent bug)
       33. Patch from Dan Espen for keeping long icon names on screen
       34. Made builtin function searching faster (hopefully) using
           simple binary search (mostly to help speed up startup
           time).  Please let me know how this works since my
           relatively simple setup isn't a good test case for this...
       35. Removed 'raise_it' entirely, since no longer used
       36. Made window move paging match Edgescroll values instead of
           always doing full screens (should this be an option?)
       37. Focus command no longer raises - use an interpreted
           focus-and-raise function if that's desired
       38. Minor menu code bug fixed - wasn't always ungrabbing the
           cursor before executing function (timing dependent - most
           of the time ok)
       39. Fixes for DEC Alpha compile warnings
       40. Fix for IconBox -0 handling, from Ric Lister

2.0.45

           handles old behavior)
       15. Added decor_examples in sample.fvwmrc dir, which contains a
           few examples of the new Decor/BorderStyle/TitleStyle stuff
           (from lar3ry gensch, Martin Cartwright, Paul Smith)

2.0.44

Jan 15, 1997 (figured I should start putting dates in here...)

Version   2.0.44 has finially been released,   with lots of fixes, and
some  new stuff that I  finially gave in on.   For all you fans of the
various  fvwm hacks that keep   showing up (fvwm95, fvwm-xpm, etc)  be
sure      to   check   out  the    new    optional   at   compile time
BorderStyle/TitleStyle/UseDecor stuff...    I'm     looking for   good
examples for them to put in the sample fvwm2rc files.  If anyone comes
up with some that  they might like to   contribute, feel free  to mail
them to the fvwm mailing list.

       1. More man page and FAQ updates
       2. More minor Imake fixes
       3. Patch for IconGeometry placement problems and probs running
          on multiple displays from Graham Barr
       4. Changed Next/Prev 'CurrentScreen' to be 'CurrentPage' and
          added 'CurrentPageAnyDesk', based on patch by Dan Niles
       5. Updated FvwmIconMan from Brady Montz
       6. Fix so FvwmGoodStuff in extras would compile ok
       7. Added Perl routines (fvwmperl in extras dir) for aid in
          making modules written in Perl, from Dan Astoorian
       8. Hopefully fixed long standing startup timing bug in which
          some windows didn't get Style attributes or borders (by
          fixing when server was grabbed and making sure it didn't get
          ungrabbed to early accidentally)
       9. Added FlipFocus function from Dan Niles, to toggle between
          two windows easily
       10. Patch for EdgeResistance timer problem from Mike Blatchley
       11. Patch to FvwmAudio so it works again (new module message
           type M_STRING wasn't recognized) plus other minor fixes and
           enhancements (like being able to use the rplay 'say'
           command and have arbitrary strings instead of sound file
           names), from Albrecht Kadlec
       12. Fixes to FvwmConsole from Toshi Isogai, plus added his
           FvwmCommand to the extras directory (for sending fvwm
           commands from a shell script).
       13. Patch for dynamic icon title recalculation from Ric Lister.
       14. Updates to fvwmrc_convert from Bill Oswald, with some more
           minor mods from me to make it easier to customize for your
           site.
       15. Added 'Echo' function.
       16. Patch to FvwmForm to handle TrueColor from Chris Laas
       17. Changed fcntl in module.c to use O_NONBLOCK (POSIX) instead
           of O_NDELAY (early SYSV) due to differences in behavior on
           some systems (Pyramid SYSV for instance, pointed out by
           Mark Wedel)
       18. Added Python routines (fvwmpython in extras dir) for aid in
           making moduules written in Python, from Barry Warsaw
       19. FvwmBacker now sets root window when it's invoked as well
           as on desk changes
       20. CatchFatal no longer makes XLib calls (to prevent some
           infinite looping under Digital Unix & Solaris), patch from
           Grant McDorman.
       21. Added Andrew Veliath's TitleBar pixmap patch (optional at
           compile time)
       22. Added patch for timing bug in pager when dragging windows
           across desktops under Solaris from Grant McDorman
       23. Added RefreshWindow function, at the request of Mike Kazda.
       24. Changed default XORValue to 1
       25. Changed SmartPlacement behavior to be "stubborn" (like 1.xx
           StubbornPlacement option) and not place over icons (if you
           don't want this you can compile with NO_STUBBORN_PLACEMENT).
       26. Added extras/FvwmScript (which replaces extras/FvwmForm2)
           from Frederic Cordier (although I think it should be
           renamed to something like FvwmFormScript).  It can now
           swallow programs like FvwmButtons.
       27. Sample .fvwm2rc updates, default system.fvwm2rc file now
           minimal to encourange site customization, added more sample
           files to go with it.
       28. Added info to FvwmIdent
       29. Added MiniIcon patch from Brady Montz (optional at compile
           time)
       30. Added BorderStyle border textures (+ TitleStyle, UseDecor,
           etc) patch from Andrew Veliath, part of which was inspired
           by the idea from 'The Rasterman' Carsten Haitzler (optional
           at compile time)
       31. Consolidated Recapture and CaptureAllWindows
       32. Fixes for unmapping problems (patch from Grant McDorman)
       33. Removed redundancy in module.c in Broadcast* funcs.
       34. Multiple -f & -cmd parms now allowed (10 max)
       35. Merged fvwmlib code into some common files, and moved some
           functions out of fvwm proper into them.
       36. Added GlobalOpts builtin (for various options that should
           become Style options later) - this is temporary.  I know
           it's ugly, but I didn't feel like adding 6 (or more)
           temporary functions (lazy, I know...)
       37. Added (GlobalOpts) global option
           SmartPlacementIsReallySmart (may become parm to
           SmartPlacement, or whole new CleverPlacement style after
           the Great Style Flag Rewrite) which uses clever placement
           code from Anthony Martin
       38. Started adding new parsing code based on ideas in patch
           from Albrecht Kadlec, for more consistent parsing.  More
           and more code in fvwm will be converted to use these...
       39. Added WindowListFunc and made built in window list use it
           by default (instead of RAISE_IT), to allow for various
           actions to be controlled by the builtin window list (like
           to warp the pointer or not warp the pointer when giving it
           the focus, or perhaps do something like run FvwmIdent on
           it).  It is interpreted, so you can destroy it and write
           your own version of this default WindowList function.
       40. WindowList now takes reasonable optional parameters instead
           of those cryptic numbers (including an optional function to
           use instead of the default WindowListFunc), based on patch
           from Albrecht Kadlec.
       41. Added WindowId function, sort of like Next & Prev, to force
           a function to happen on a specified WindowID.
       42. Updated FvwmAuto from Albrecht Kadlec (now takes parameters
           for functions to be run on focus in & focus out).
       41. Read funcs now output what they are going to execute if
           -debug parameter was passed in.
       42. Should now be sending synthetic ConfigureNotify on stacking
           changes (for potential motif menubar problems).
       43. Added WindowShade function from Andrew Veliath
       44. Added (GlobalOpts) global options to modify ClickToFocus
           selections: ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick/PassesClick,
           ClickToFocusDoesntRaise/Raises (may become parms to
           ClickToFocus after the Great Style Flag Rewrite)
       45. UseStyle should now parse quoted Style refs correctly,
           courtesy of Andrew Veliath.
       46. Added Randall Winchester's CLICKTORAISE compile time option patch
       47. Patch from Greg Badros for FvwmButtons font coredump
       48. Patch from Greg Badros so FvwmM4 passes opts not recognized
           directly to M4 (so -m4opt not needed) and -outfile option.
           Added these to FvwmCpp as well.
       49. Fixes for compiling under Linux for DEC Alpha from Ilkka E
           T Tuohela

2.0.43
       1. More man page updates & Imake fixes
       2. Simple patch to help take care of some timing bugs
       3. Patch to fix resize oddities when hitting 'hard' edge introduced
          by EdgeScroll loop patch
       4. Fixed startup w/ no rc bug, plus added more defaults, so if
          started without an rc file, things should run ok.  Plus it now
          outputs error messages if Read fails, then tries to Read
          system.fvwm2rc (after first read fails).
       5. Patch to fix UseStyle problem w/ BackColor
       6. More FAQ updates
       7. Created an 'extras' dir, and moved some of the existing modules
          in there (the ones that aren't being built by default).
       8. More potential speedups in event processing
       9.  Decoupled warp from Focus, adding WarpToWindow function.
       10. Added SendToModule builtin to send arbitrary strings to modules
           to help implement more complex dynamic module abilities and
           allow for module to module communication
       11. Put old FvwmButtons back as FvwmGoodStuff, for people who
           prefer the simpler older version (in extras dir).  Also made it
           able to be passed in the name parameter on invocation so it
           doesn't have to be symbolically linked to the new names any
           more.
       12. Adding a new module FvwmForm2 in the extras directory,
           contributed by Frederic Cordier.  Based on FvwmForm but
           completely rewritten apparently.  It uses scripts, has a new
           more complex syntax (Pascal like) and adds RadioButtons.  I
           would like to eventually combine aspects of the two versions
           (and more) to make one killer module, perhaps.
       13. Made fvwm_msg send errors to modules, so FvwmTalk sees them
           like it used to (and any other module that looks for M_ERROR
           in the future)
       14. Added DestroyModuleConfig, based on patch from Toshi Isogai
       15. Modules can now send module config commands to fvwm (eg FvwmTalk)
       16. Removed implicit Exec exec stuff for the time being, until I
           come up with a better way to do it (back to old behavior)
       17. More mini icons added and some icons removed
       18. Added "KillMe" command that modules can send to fvwm asking for
           an assisted suicide (almost called this Kevorkian :)).  Mark
           Crimmins wanted this for probs with TkGoodStuff.
       19. Fixed RaiseWindow bug under some servers when no icon pixmap.
       20. Fixed one prob w/ FvwmAuto and menus being hidden (under click
           to focus - still needs work for other focus policies, but not
           entirely sure how to approach this yet).
       21. Added ExitFunction, to be executed on exit (before restarts too).
           Useful for explicitly killing modules, etc.
       22. Changed behavior of '-f' to just specify config file (now use
           -cmd to perform an actual command, like -cmd 'FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc')
       23. Updates to FvwmSaveDesk from Carsten Paeth so it should now
           actually work under 2.xx, plus some other bugfixes too I
           believe.
       24. Added PipeRead function, which executes a program and Read's
           it's output.  Useful for making dynamic menus and such.
       25. Security fix for FvwmM4 & FvwmCpp from Austin Donnelly
       26. Added strerror for SunOS 4.1.x
       27. Added ability to remove mouse and key bindings without restart
           (do the binding but specify '-' as the function).  Probably
           needs more checking for removing mouse bindings from title bar
           buttons correctly, though.
       28. Updates to FvwmIconMan from Brady Montz.
       29. Updates to FvwmIconBox from Nobutaka Suzuki.
       30. Patch from Austin Donnelly for multi-keypress required for
           WindowList problem.
       31. Patch to center text on left pixmaps in menus.
       32. Patch to allow menus to pop up left if not enough room on right
           (currently in ifdef -> define LEFT_MENUS to enable when compiling).

2.0.42
       1. More small Imake fixes & man page updates
       2. Optional Xpm support for titlebar buttons patch from Andrew
          Veliath
       3. Made event handler jump table be a bigger default size, since
          LASTEvent doesn't account for X Extension related events (eg
          SHAPE)
       4. FvwmPager display updates: DeskColor patch from Alan Wild,
          line distinctions between desks and pages, reinstated message mask
       5. Patch to make fvwm recognize some OpenLook WM hints (like MWM
          hints) from Andrew Taylor
       6. Added FvwmIconMan module (by Brady Montz)
       7. Replaced FvwmButtons with New & Improved version from Jarl Totland,
          had to patch to get to work ok under AIX (char's are unsigned by
          default under AIX)
       8. Added DestroyFunc for removing function definitions
       9. Made Exec use $SHELL, like mwm, if ExecUseSHELL is specified,
          plus Exec now does an explicit "exec" as the first arg (if it's
          not there already), to eliminate extra processes
       10. Completely replaced fvwm_err (removed) & most fprintf calls
           (those that were appropriate) w/ fvwm_msg (which has
           variable args, a consistent look, and will eventually
           optionally output to a file as well as to stderr)
       11. Fix from Nobutaka Suzuki for probs w/ Next/Prev Focus
       12. Patch from Henrique to make EdgeScroll wrap cleaner
       13. Patches to FvwmIconBox from Nobutaka Suzuki
       14. Patches for caching xpm files, modules having Popups on
           ButtonPress events, & rc line continuation (from Jarl)
       15. Make SHAPE extension runtime determinite in addition to compile
           time so same exec can run on different machines better (John
           Bazik, the author of XMX wanted this) - Haven't fixed up the
           modules that use SHAPE yet though (next release)
       16. New module FvwmConsole (a good potential replacement for
           FvwmTalk) from Toshi Isogai.  Currently won't build as part of
           the normal process (you'll have to do it by hand until I
           integrate it further).
       17. Added more mini icons from list members.
       18. Added new-system.fvwmrc, which is the beginning of a
           reformatted & commented rc file (from Eli Burke).  Feel free to
           provide your $0.02 on it.

2.0.41
       1. More FAQ updates & man page corrections
       2. Patch to limit GetFdWidth to FD_SETSIZE to prevent fvwm from
          eating too much cpu under bsdi if 'unlimit descriptors' is used
       3. Ressurrected desktop edge wrap via EdgeScroll*1000 feature
       4. Fixed library link order (fixes the sometimes undefined
          XLoadQueryFont problem)
       5. Renamed fvwm_icons subdir to be just icons, documentation to be
          just docs
       6. Removed FvwmPrompt (use FvwmForm instead, since it's better anyways)
       7. Todd Fries 'UseStyle' patch
       8. XClientMessages sent to icon windows (that aren't
          XA_WM_CHANGE_STATE ones) are now sent along to to the apps
          window
       9. FvwmButtons fixes from Jarl for incorrectly drawn buttons and
          better no title handling
       10. FvwmForm now uses GetFontOrFixed, instead of silently failing
           if font can't be found
       11. New Imake setup based on patch from Mark Powell (let's see if
           people have less problems with this, since it's more 'standard'
           now)
       12. Changed top directory to contain version number
       13. Modified Style parsing to (hopefully) do less string compares
           for a potential speedup
       14. Modified DispatchEvent to use a jump table instead of a switch
           statement, again for a potential speedup
       15. FvwmIconBox patches from Nobutaka Suzuki

2.0.40
       1. Removed 'basename' reference
       2. More small Imake fixes
       3. Renamed FvwmConfig .cc files to .C, because some C++ compilers
          can't handle the .cc extension (AIX's, for instance)
       4. FvwmForm now gets config info in standard way
       5. FvwmBanner now dissappears if you click on it (like in 1.xx)
       6. Renamed FvwmConfig's makefile to Makefile.std and cleaned it up
       7. More small man page cleanups
       8. Improved handling of nonexistant fonts (added GetFontOrFixed)
       9. More debug messges, and central fvwm_msg function for printing
          msgs (started converting fvwm_err and fprintf calls to use this
          instead, as it has variable args and allows for a consistent
          message feel and I'll use this to add -outfile <file> option
          eventually to capture all fvwm output to a file as well as
          stderr)
       10. Fixed function parm $9 coredump
       11. Added basic TitleStyle (for justfication & edge appearance)

2.0.39
       1. More Imake fixes from Randall Winchester
       2. Started adding optional debug messages, to help people help me
          solve problems that I can't reproduce (a define in configure.h
          to enable these, off by default)
       3. Added -blackout option, to black out screen during init and
          recapture (no blackout is default now)
       4. Removed some unused variables, cleaned up some code that
          generated compiler warnings
       5. More small doc & FAQ updates
       6. Fix for using "None" as font in FvwmPager to not have a Label
          (it now works)
       7. Making Resource = "NoResource" instead of "Untitled" (if class
          hints res_name is NULL) to differentiate between window Name &
          window Resource so Style commands for windows that have a
          WM_NAME but no WM_CLASS don't match Untitled
       8. Simple FvwmWinList refresh patch
       9. Added Imakefile for FvwmConfig (only works under X11R6)

2.0.38
       1. Fixed FvwmPager to die without causing X server to eat CPU if
          running under FvwmButtons & FvwmButtons dies or is killed
       2. Went to new M.I.P version number system in preparation for first
          official release (which will be 2.1.0 - until then fvwm is still
          pre-official release)
       3. Small fix to makefile for FvwmConfig
       4. More [icon_]name == NULL checks/fixes
       5. Added some things left out from Imakefiles, makefile.h & configure.h
       6. FvwmButtons now handles Exec "" foobar correctly.
       7. Added Ludvig A. Norin's wonderful mini xpm icons
       8. Made scanForPixmap keep %name% or *name* in strings (restores
          original string) if pixmaps can't be found (this also allows
          window list to work for names w/ % or * in them too, or actually
          display a pixmap if it's in the window name), and corrected 2 col
          menu display bug that this showed (2nd col text didn't account for
          width of left justified pixmap)

pl 36 to 37
       1. Fixed coredump due to incomplete backout of NoName/NoClass patch
       2. Fix for multiple env var expansion core dump from Sverre H. Huseby
       3. Small doc fixes (spelling, etc)
       4. Imakefile/configure.h enhancements from Randall S. Winchester
       5. Updated system.fvwmrc (FvwmIconBox changes from Nobutaka Suzuki)

pl 35 to 36
       1. Some more doc cleanups & FAQ updates, plus renamed fvwm.man to
          fvwm2.man, w/ symlink for fvwm.man (so install.man works correctly
          with rename of exec)
       2. Made utils subdir for scripts, added quantize_pixmap script
       3. FvwmPagerDeskTopScale patch
       4. Small changes to configure.h defaults, plus added XPMINCLUDE
          and FVWM_MAN_DIR
       5. Added 'make depend' to MakeMakefiles script
       6. Reverting NoClass patch completely, as I think it's causing
          other problems
       7. Small change to make windows seem to close faster (hopefully)
       8. Patches to FvwmButtons to make it behave better when killed
          (kill swallowed modules, catch signals, etc)
       9. Patch from Sverre H. Huseby for env vars in ModulePath, PixmapPath
          and IconPath
       10. Patch to FvwmCpp for -cppopt to work correctly
       11. Added FvwmDebug back to distribution (still needs to be updated)
       12. Added BUGS file for known bugs

pl 34 to 35
       0. New maintainer for fvwm now, please go easy on him :)
       1. Fixed Title & Icon name change bug introduced in pl 34
       2. Applied another patch from Frederic Devernay
                  a. Keeps no class windows having no class & now handles
                     correctly
       3. Removed some extraneous files from the distribution, added
          preliminary FAQ, INSTALL & TO-DO files, added small README.
       4. Made conversion_script runnable
       5. Fixed FvwmPrompt
       6. Patch to rename fvwm & .fvwmrc in configure.h added (on by default)
       7. Compile date & time added to -version.
       8. FvwmBanner Xpm & timeout can now be specified in fvwmrc

pl 33 to 34
       1. Applied patches from Frederic Devernay
	          a. Improved reading of window and icon names
		  b. improved handling of windows with no class.

pl 32 to 33
       1. More fixes to move/resize window when using m4.
       2. Added Sloppy Focus to FvwmConfig. Made FvwmConfig obtain initial
	  focus mode from fvwm.
       3. Add SCREEN macro to fvwmm4.
       4. Applied FvwmWinList patches.

pl 31 to 32
       1. Fixed color specification problem for ForeColor and BackCOlor
	  styles, so things like rgb:rr/gg/bb work again.
       2. Made MWMMenus style take effect on the Size/Resize window
	  even when using M4. Color selection of the Size/Resize window
	  is still broken.

pl 30 to 31
       1. Added patch to make FvwmButtons and FvwmPager accept -0
          geometries.
       2. Added code to FvwmConfig to make it read in current values for
	  colors and desktop sizes as it starts up. Made it handle case
	  of no more colors in colormap.


pl 29 to 30
       1. Added color selection to fvwmconfig

pl 28 to 29
       1. Fixed problem of lost root window key bindings with FvwmM4
       2. Minor adjustments to FvwmConfig. Included a makefile. Compiles
	  with Sun's CC now, as well as with g++
pl 27 to 28
       1. Patch to FvwmButtons to fix the button-popping out problem.
       1. Added FvwmConfig. Requires g++ version 2.6.3 or thereabouts.
	  not automatically built or installed. Do it yourself.

pl 26 to 27
       1. Minor fix to FvwmScroll affecting handling of window resizes.
       2. Fixed core-dump problem (maybe) in pl26
pl 25 to 26
       1. Corlormap handling bug fix.
       2. Finally, after years and years of saying, "thats not a
	  problem because people shouldn't have windows that small",
	  if fixed the handling of the corner pieces for teeny-tiny
	  windows.
pl 24 to 25
       1. Incorporated  colormap-focus patches
       2. Incorporated loads of patches - I have no idea what they
	  do, but at least the following
	   - allow use of ESC key to abort a move/resize
	   - Something about usign pager on B&W  display.
	   - stuff for FvwmIconBox
	   - stuff for FvwmWinList

pl 23 to 24
       1. Man page updates for style function
       2. Added stuff to over-ride motif modal dialogs. Makes apps
          think that mwm is running, but fvwm doesn't handle the
	  modality, so use with care. You have to set the
	  compilation flag: MODALITY_IS_EVIL in configure.h to enable this
	  feature. Netscape users may wish to try this out.

pl 22 to 23
       1. Applied patches to FvwmIconBox and FvwmWinList.

pl 21 to 22
       1. Applied patch to fix up multi-screen support a little.
       2. Changed some strcasecmp calls to mystrcasecmp.
       3. Other stuff, can't remember what! (bug fixes)

pl 20 to 21
       1. Little bug-fix with motif-pop-up/pull-down menus and window
          focus
       2. Applied FvwmIconBox patch.
       3. Applied FvwmButtons patch to let you activate with a key press
          (return key) instead of mouse button.
       4. Re-worked the forking process for multi-screen displays. Can't
          test it, maybe someone can fix it now.

pl 19 to 20.
       1. Fixed resize buglet
       2. applied FvwmIconBox patch

pl 18 to 19.
       1. Not much

pl 17 to 18
       1. Fixed loss of key bindings on root window
       2. Fixed compile error in Picture.c
pl 16 to 17
       1. Applied patch to FvwmAudio.
       2. Allow menu-pixmaps to be above or to the left of
          menu labels, or both.
       3. Adjusted resize behavior for windows whose aspect
          ratio had max == min. Behavior was a little weird before.
       4. Added built-in KillModule
       5. Some changes to allow evil, poorly designed override-redirect
          windows to install their own colormaps. This abuse of override
	  redirect windows is primarily used by WABI, but a few others
	  too, I guess. This change is fairly fundamental, and could cause
	  problems. Also, if WABI comes up with a private colormap, it
	  is given control of the colormap immediately, since it thinks
	  that it should have focus.

pl 15 to 16
       1. Applied patch to make menu short cuts work
       2. Made this menu config work as expected:
	  "*xcalc.xpm*"     Exec  exec xcalc &
       3. Restored ability to insert blank lines in
          menus, not just separators.
       4. Allow bitmaps in menus as well as xpm's
pl 14 to 15
       1. Added option to put pixmaps in menus.
          Modify your menu labels like so:
	  was:

+         "Calculator"     Exec  exec xcalc &
          is
+         "Calculator*xcalc.xpm*"     Exec  exec xcalc &
          pretty kool, man!

pl 13 to pl 14
       1. Assorted minor bug patches.

pl 12 to pl 13
       1. Applied patches
           A. Something about XSetIOErrorHandler. Doesn`t seem to hurt,
	   but I don't know what it does.
       2. Patches for FvwmIconBox. Nobutaka Suzuki has been working hard
          on this top-notch module, and seems to be working to integrate
	  it more tightly with fvwm itself. The latest patches let the
	  IconBox read the Icon pixmap names from fvwm. Icons are only
	  shown in the IconBox if the NoIcon style is applied. Is this
	  right?

	  To get something in the icon-box, you can use
	  Style "XTerm" Icon xterm.xpm, NoIcon

       1. Added FvwmForm module. It looks like its for 1.24r, but seems
          to work with Fvwm-2.
       2. Tried to add Tom Feng's GoodStuff patches, but they are
          incompatible with other changes.

pl 11 to pl 12
       1. Really fixed that memory problem in builtins.c this time.
       2. Fixed the inverting shading of the maximize button
          if MWMButtons is used.
pl 10 to pl 11
       1. Fixed some references to already freed memory areas,
          specifically related to FocusOnNextTimeStamp and Scr.Ungrabbed.
	  Only affected click-to-focus, and only soon after destroying
	  a window.
       2. Plugged a memory leak (?) in builtins.c. Watch out, maybe I
          broke something instead of fixing it. Not sure.


pl 9 to pl 10
       1. Fixed double click on title-button 1 problem. It used to work,
          but only if the mouse was not moved at all. Now, 3 pixels of
	  mouse movement are allowed, and the double-click action will
	  still be performed. After 3 pixels, the double click action is
	  aborted.
       2. Fixed problem with focus in focus-follows-mouse mode, when
          changing desks. Some click-to-focus person sent in a patch which
	  caused focus to be returned to the last window that had focus on
	  desk N, when you switch to desk N. That was fine, but if there
	  was no such window, focus went to a sticky window. That was bad.
	  You see, I'm focus-follows-mouse, but I make most of my sticky
	  windows click-to-focus (ie pager), because I really don't want
	  it to get the focus. The above patch made the sticky window get
	  focus when switching desks, when I really wanted the root window
	  to get the focus (for keyboard activated menus, etc).
       3. Added a DestroyMenu function.


pl 8 to 9
       1. Fixed misc bugs.
              A. Menus popped up in wrong place when NoButton style was
	         used.
	      B. Title bar would look pressed in if you moved out of it
	         by key presses.
       2. Added #define SCREEN 0 (or whatever) for fvwmcpp.
       3. Applied patch to FvwmIconBox.
pl7 to 8
       1. Fixed (probably) some unwanted free()s in the code.
          These caused core dumps on some machines.

pl6 to 7:
       1. Fixed IconBox style
       2. Fixed (?) FvwmM4 problem with not executing InitFunction &
          restartfunction, etc
       3. Fixed FvwmIdent module (Sticky, Ontop, Iconified, etc).
       4. Fixed StickyIcon style.
       5. Fixed FvwmWinList

pl 5 to 6
       1. Applied patch to FvwmAudio
       2. Applied patch to FvwmIconBox
       3. Got patch for m4 handling, didn't do anything.
       4. applied FvwmPager patch to eliminate flicker when
          selecting a window on the current page.
pl4 to 5
       1. Fixed FvwmM4 again.
pl3 to 4
       1. Fixed FvwmM4.

pl2 to 3
       1. Removed an unnecessary debugging printf
       2. Fixed FvwmBanner
       3. switched vfork back to fork, since some people apparantly
          don't have vfork.
       4. Changed the name of system.fvwmrc to .fvwmrc because its easier
          to handle within the program. Modified documentation and the
	  install stuff in the Imakefile
       5. Fiddled with time-stamp stuff a bit, so that maybe when people
          change their system clocks, it won't cause everything to stop.
       6. Fixed a cause of core-dumps in the Next, Prev, None commands.

pl1 to pl2
       1. Assorted trivial bug fixes. Maybe something important too,
          I forgot.

2.0 pl 1:
       1. Switched from fork() to vfork() in two places. Its supposed to
       be better when you're only doing an exec anyway.

       2. Made fvwm parse out module arguments in a more standard way.
       see documentation/modules.tex for more details.

       3. Added FvwmM4 module. See its man page.
       4. Added FvwmCpp module.

2.0 The beginning of time.
