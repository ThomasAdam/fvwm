  command.  Also has new options for spacing the buttons:
  WindowButtonsLeftMargin, WindowButtonsRightMargin, and
  StartButtonRightMargin.  See man page for details.

* Style switches can be prefixed with '!' to inverse their meaning.
  For example, "Style * Sticky" is the same as "Style * !Slippery".

  dynamical actions using SendToModule, see the man page:

    ChangeButton <button-id> <properties-to-change>
    ExpandButtonVars <button-id> <command-to-expand>

  Inactive means InactiveUp + InactiveDown, similarly for shortcuts
  ToggledActive and ToggledInactive.

* More shortcuts for button states added: AllNormal, AllToggled,
  AllActive, AllInactive, AllUp, AllDown.  These six shortcuts are
  actually different masks for 4 individual states (from 8 total).

* FPClickToFocus and FPClickToRaise work with any modifier by
  default.

* Perl library API regarding event handlers is changed, so personal
  modules in Perl should be adjusted.

* Allow the use of mouse buttons other than the first in
  FvwmWinList when invoked transient.

* ImagePath now supports directories in form "/some/directory;.png"
  (where semicolon delimits a file extension that files in
  /some/directory have.  This file extension replaces the original
  image extension (if any) or it is added if there is no extension.
  For example with: Style XTerm MiniIcon mini/xterm.xpm
  the file /some/directory/mini/xterm.png is searched.

  packets. External modules relying on this interface no longer
  work.

  if the target page was at a negative x or y page displacement
  from the current viewport, the window would be placed on the
  wrong page.

* New Style option IconSize for restricting icon sizes.

* New WindowList options SortClassName, MaxLabelWidth, NoLayer,
  ShowScreen, ShowPage, ShowPageX and ShowPageY.

* Restored old way of handling clicks in windows with ClickToFocus
  and ClickToFocusPassesClickOff.  This fixes a problem with
  click+drag in an unfocused rxvt or aterm window.

* Fixed wrong warp coordinates when WarpToWindow was used with two
  arguments on an unmanaged window.

* Vastly improved FvwmEvent performance.

* FvwmAuto can operate on Enter and Leave events too.  This makes
  it possible to have auto raising with ClickToFocus and
  NeverFocus. See -menter and -menterleave options and examples in
  the FvwmAuto man page.

* The "hangon" strings in FvwmButtons support wild cards.

* New option "Icon" to PlaceAgain command.

    Style * MouseFocusClickRaisesOff

  or vice versa no longer work as like before.  Remove the second
  line to fix the problem.  ClickToFocusRaises now works only on
  the client part of a window, not on the decorations as it did
  before.

* New color limit method for screens that only display 256 colors
  (or less).

* In depth less or equal to 16 image and gradient can be
  dithered. This can be enabled/disabled by using the new
  dither/nodither options to the Colorset command.

* Removed the styles MouseFocusClickIgnoreMotion and
  MouseFocusClickIgnoreMotionOff again.

* Many new focus policy styles "FP..." and "!FP...".

* The I18N_MB patch (--enable-multibyte) has been
  rewritten. MULTIBYTE is used to identify what is was I18N_MB. A
  set of locale functions (locale initialization, font loading,
  text drawing, ...etc.) is created in libs/Flocale.{c,h} and used
  in the entire fvwm code (but FvwmWharf).  Font loading and
  memory management is improved in the multibyte case.

* Better support of non ISO-8859-1 window and icon titles. See the
  --disable-compound-text option in INSTALL.fvwm for more
  details.

* Added anti-aliased text rendering support using Xft (use
  --enable-xft to enable it). Recent versions of XFree and
  freetype2 are needed (see the FONT NAMES AND FONT LOADING

  Error).  This return code can be checked and tied to an action
  with the new commands Cond and CondCase.

  with the new contexts '[', ']', '-', '_', '<', '^', '>' and
  'v'.

  the maximized geometry of windows and maximize them as
  necessary.  Very useful to make a window larger manually and
  then get back the old geometry with a click.

* New command ResizeMoveMaximize similarly.

* New styles FixedPPosition, FixedUSPosition, FixedSize,
  FixedUSSize, FixedPSize, VariablePPosition, VariableUSPosition,
  VariableSize, VariableUSSize, and VariablePSize.

* Actions can be bound to windows swallowed in FvwmButtons.  To
  disable this feature for a specific button, the new option
  ActionIgnoresClientWindow can be used.

* Fvwm respect the extended window manager hints
  specification. This allows fvwm to work with KDE version >= 2
  and GNOME version 2. This support is configurable using a bunch
  of new commands and style options, search for "EWMH" in the man
  page.

* New DateFormat option in FvwmTaskBar to change the date format
  in the clock's popup tip.

* Window titlebars may now be designed using a new powerful
  TitleStyle option MultiPixmap, that enables to specify separate

* Geometry (-g) command line option to FvwmButtons.

* *FvwmPagerSloppyFocus option: To focus a window, simply move the
  pointer over the window's mini window in the pager.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in beta release 2.3.6 (August 1999)

* New function variables $c, $r, $n.

* The new commands QuitSession, SaveSession, SaveQuitSession allow
  to manage the session from the window manager.

* If you use xsm session manager, which has buggy discard command
  implementation, set environment $SESSION_MANAGER_NAME to "xsm".
  If you use another SM, unset this variable or set to something
  else.

* New module FvwmTheme for creating Colorsets that can be shared
  with fvwm and other modules when they have been modified.

* If you never define an iconbox, or you fill all the iconboxes,
  fvwm has a default icon box that covers the screen, it filled
  top to bottom, then left to right, and has an 80x80 pixel grid.

* The new styles LowerTransient and DontLowerTransient allow to
  control if the transients of a window are lowered when the
  window itself is lowered (default) or not.

* The Restart function has been partially rewritten. If you were
  using 'Restart' without any parameters and wonder why changes in
  your configuration file are not used during a restart you should
  use 'Restart --dont-preserve-state' instead.

* New menu styles VerticalItemSpacing and VerticalTitleSpacing
  allow control over the height of menu items and titles.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in alpha release 2.3.5 (July 1999)

* New special functions Session{Init|Restart|Exit}Function are
  called instead of {Init|Restart|Exit}Function when running under
  a session manager.

* New form for setting root cursor: FvwmForm FormFvwmRootCursor. .

* Fvwm web files are now in a separate CVS tree.

* All modules except FvwmScript and FvwmGTK share fvwm's visual.

* The behaviour of the Raised and Visible flags for Next,
  Circulate, ... commands has been changed. They now do what their
  names suggest, i.e. visible = partially visible and raised =
  fully visible.

* The new styles RaiseTransient and DontRaiseTransient allow to
  control if the transients of a window are raised when the window
  itself is raised (default) or not.

* A new action type 'H' for 'Hold' can be assigned to complex fvwm
  functions. It is triggered when the button is pressed and held
  longer than ClickTime milliseconds.

* The activedow-button and inactive-button configure options have
  been replaced with the ButtonState built in command.

* Most of the configure options have been removed.

* The cursors used for resizing and selecting windows and handling
  menus have changed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in alpha release 2.3.4 (June 1999)

* Fvwm is GNOME compliant.

* Dynamic menus enhancement: The special menu item name
  'MissingSubmenuFunc' alows to create submenus on the fly. See
  manpage on 'AddToMenu' for details.

* The Restart command accepts simple shell-like syntax now.

* Added support for mouse strokes recognition, uses LibStroke 0.3
  by Mark Willey(willey@etla.net).
  (http://www.etla.net/~willey/projects/libstroke/)


-------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in alpha release 2.3.3 (June 1999)

* There can be two mini icons per menu label instead of one now.

* Menu enhancements: the layout of the menu items can be
  controlled in detail with the ItemFormat option for the
  MenuStyle command. The width of the borders around menus and
  hilighted items can be controlled with the options BorderWidth
  and Hilight3DThickness (MenuStyle). Menu behavior can be
  mirrored with the SumbenusLeft option (hard to describe, it's
  best to try it out). A menu item can get up to three different
  labels. The first two are left aligned, the third is right
  aligned by default.

* Colour gradients may use up to 1000 colours. The old limit was
  128 colours.

* New command MaxWindowSize limits the initial dimensions of a
  window.

* Include fvwmbug script for reporting bugs.

* New button states ToggledActiveUp, ToggledActiveDown,
  ToggledInactive for customizing, as an example, the "maximized"
  appearance of the maximize button.

* New button style flag MWMDecorStick to support toggle buttons
  for the Stick function.

* New condition [!]shaded for Current and other commands taking
  conditions.

* New menu styles HoldSubmenus/DeleteSubmenus. HoldSubmenus is the
  new default for mwm and fvwm menus. When you move back from a
  submenu to its parent menu the submenu remains visible.

* Menus can be visible multiple times at once.

* Restarting fvwm no longer moves the viewport to (0,0).

* New style DepressableBorder/FirmBorder to influence the
  appearance of the window border under button presses.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in alpha release 2.3.2 (May 1999)

* The Alt-Tab binding to invoke the window list as described in
  the FAQ is  now built-in.  You can remove it as described in the
  fvwm man page.

* The MoveThreshold command lets the user fine tune the threshold
  when a click becomes a move. It works in FvwmPager too.

* New style IconOverride/NoIconOverride/NoActiveIconOverride to
  influence the overriding behaviour of the Icon style.

* The FvwmCommand module is now much faster and can thus
  comfortably be used in shell scripts. The tradeoff is that it
  does not report errors any more. To get the old behaviour run
  FvwmCommand with the '-i 1' option.

* Dynamic menus are provided by the special menu items
  'DynamicPopupAction' and 'DynamicPopdownAction'. See the man
  page on 'AddToMenu' for details.

* System-wide config files are now in ${sysconfdir}/fvwm
  (i.e. /usr/local/etc/fvwm by default) as many files are now
  installed there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in alpha release 2.3.1 (April 1999)

* New button style flag MWMDecorShade to support toggle buttons
  for shaded windows.

* Daily snapshots of the development sources available on our web
  page.

* FixedPosition style: disables moving the window.

* IgnoreRestack style: forbids clients to change their own
  stacking order position.

* The NoWarp option to the Focus command for focusing window on a
  different page without switching to that page.

* Fvwm raises icon titles when the pointer is over the icon.

* The cursors used for the pan frames at the edge of the screen
  can be changed.

* StaysOnBottom style.

* ResizeHintOverride style: a window with this style can be
  resized beyond the program supplied minimum and maximum
  size. This is a hack to make fvwm cooperate with broken
  applications.

* NeverFocus style: windows with this style never receive the
  focus.

* New command: DefaultIcon to set the default icon.

* New command line arguments -visual and -visualId.

* GrabFocusTransient is a new style that does the same as
  GrabFocus, but only for transient windows.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in alpha release 2.3.0 (February 1999)

* FvwmPipe and FvwmConfig modules have been removed.

* New command: RecaptureWindow captures a single window.

* 'GotoDesk' command replaces former command 'Desk' (the old name
  is still supported.

* 'Restart fvwm2' preserves almost all per-window using the file
  $FVWM_USERHOME/.fvwm_restart.

* #define PICK_TRUECOLOR will make fvwm use the best TrueColor
  #Visual.  This is for those poor unfortunates with legacy apps
  #that crash if the default visual is not an 8 bit PseudoColor
  #(but fortunate enough to have a 24 bit server that supports
  #both 8 bit and 24 bit TrueColor)

* New command line argument -replace. fvwm will try to "take over"
  from a running wm only if it is given.

* ImagePath and ModulePath commands now expand '+' to be the
  previous value of the path.

* Key and mouse bindings take effect immediately. A 'Recapture'
  was necessary before this change.

* Unmaximizing keeps windows on the same page.

* Maximize can now expand until some other window is found to
  fully utilize available screen space.

* Use the 'GrabFocusOff' style to prevent ClickToFocus windows
  taking the focus from other ClickToFocus windows when they are
  mapped the first time. The opposite option is called 'GrabFocus'
  and can be used in conjunction with MouseFocus and SloppyFocus
  too.

* New command IgnoreModifiers for ignoring the pesky num-lock key
  with key and mouse bindings.  Hint: try this command with
  XFree86:

    IgnoreModifiers L25

  If you encounter performance problems please consult the manpage
  and the FAQ.

* Enhancements to MoveToPage and GotoPage: 'prev' option to refer
  to the last visited page, negative numbers refer to lower/right
  page, suffix 'p' indicates page number relative to current
  page.

* Mailcheck interval option for FvwmTaskBar.

* Colorlimit command does nothing if display depth is greater than
  20. This helps if you want to use the same configuration on more
  than one display depth.  ColorLimit defaults to ON if display
  depth is 8 bits or less.  This should help new users.

* Maximize can now expand until some other window is found to
  fully utilize available screen space.

* FvwmWinList option *FvwmWinListFollowWindowList to display the
  order that fvwm keeps windows in. You can now see the order that
  Next/Prev will take, Prev goes down the list, Next goes up (from
  the bottom).

* WindowID command now takes conditions like Current.

* Improved cursor support: CursorStyle now supports changing
  cursor colors and creating cursors from xpm files.

* New style options: StartsLowered, StartsRaised.

* New function PlaceAgain: moves a window to where it would be
  placed.

* New module FvwmGtk. It implements menus, dialogs and
  window-lists using the GTK toolkit.

* NoInset is independent from HiddenHandles, it now works on
  NoHandles style windows.

* Made FvwmPager a bit simpler. Added -transient options to bind a
  transient pager to mouse buttons (see FvwmPager man page for an
  example).

* VMS port; see vms/README for details.

* New MenuStyle options: PopupAsRootmenu, PopupAsSubmenu

* The 'extras' directory has been merged into 'modules'; the
  --enable-extras configure flag is obsolete.

* New command: Silent. Suppresses user interaction when a window
  is needed but none is selected.

* New utility xselection which can be used with PipeRead to feed
  the content of the X Selection as commands to fvwm.

* Fvwm can now "take over" from a running (ICCCM 2 compliant) wm.

* FvwmPager can now handle pixmaps as desk backgrounds.

* Layer information is displayed in WindowList.

* Animated window shading.

* Shaded windows can be resized.

* Windows can be shaded and maximized.

* Fonts and colors are no longer hard-coded on the FvwmAnimate
  customization form.  FvwmForm can set defaults that the
  FvwmAnimate form will use.

* New commands All and Pick.

* New command XORPixmap for increased visibility of the rubber
  band lines and general spangly-ness.

* New start up sequence: all start up scripts etc. are read before
  the initial capture so windows styles will be correct, no need
  for a recapture.

* EdgeThickness can resize/hide/show panframes in mid function.

* Support for transparent Eterms etc. during opaque/animated
  moves.

* FvwmPager tracks windows during opaque/animated moves.

* Session management. Fvwm talks to a session manager
  and saves and restores its state.

* Layers. New commands Layer, DefaultLayers; new Style option,
  WindowList option and condition Layer.

* Lots of changes to FvwmForm:
  No limits of form size.
  Fonts and colors can change anywhere in the form.
  Form appearance can be configured globaly:
    Form defaults are read from .FvwmForm.
    There is a built in Default setting/saving dialogue.
  Forms can be read in directly from a file.
  Some forms are installed automatically.
  Tab to previous field.
  You can control vertical spacing on text so spacing is OK for
  help panels. A button can execute a synchronous shell command.
  You can paste into a form
  Forms can read configuration data.

* IconPath and PixmapPath are replaced by single ImagePath.  All
  images, no matter what their format are searched for along the
  ImagePath.
