Changes in release 2.1.1


Changes in release 2.1.0
* basic autoconfiguration support; see INSTALL.fvwm and INSTALL
* modules installed into ${libexecdir}/fvwm/${VERSION}
  - since the version string is encoded into the module directory, it
    is safer to rely on the compiled-in ModulePath, rather than
    setting it yourself in .fvwm2rc
* system configure (system.fvwm2rc) searched for in ${sysconfdir}
* FvwmCpp and FvwmM4 no longer define FVWMDIR variable; instead they
  define FVWM_MODULEDIR and FVWM_CONFIGDIR
