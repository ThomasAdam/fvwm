Changes in release 2.1.1
* Official home page html added to docs directory.

Changes in release 2.1.0
* basic autoconfiguration support; see INSTALL.fvwm and INSTALL
* modules installed into ${libexecdir}/fvwm/${VERSION}
  - since the version string is encoded into the module directory, it
    is safer to rely on the compiled-in ModulePath, rather than
    setting it yourself in .fvwm2rc
* system configure (system.fvwm2rc) searched for in ${sysconfdir}
* FvwmCpp and FvwmM4 no longer define FVWMDIR variable; instead they
  define FVWM_MODULEDIR and FVWM_CONFIGDIR
* FvwmAnimate added.

Changes in release 2.1-pre-beta
* The changes are too numerous to list here. There are lots of new features.
  Please check the ChangeLog.
* Brady Montz is no longer the maintainer. In the future fvwm is maintained
  by the fvwm-workers mailing list.

Yes, things have been slow.  But things are about to pick up again; Chuck
has passed the role of development coordinator to Brady Montz.  Brady must
finish other pressing business, adjust the source tree to his liking and
then development will begin again in earnest.  Check back here for info as
it happens.

Version 2.0.46 is now available, at long last...  Doesn't have all of
the stuff that I wanted to get in there, but it was taking WAY too
long for me to put it together, so the rest will have to wait until
2.0.47.  Namely, if you were looking for the animated menus patch or
the colorlimiting patch, some variation of each of those will most
likely appear in 2.0.47.  The march towards 2.1.0 continues...



Also, PLEASE be sure to read the ChangeLog entries each time you
upgrade to make sure you don't miss anything that might require you to
change something in your .fvwm2rc, etc.

Version 2.0.45 is now available.  Ok, 2.0.44 had a few flaws in
there... :)  This is essentially a quick bugfix release.


------------------------------------------------


Jan 15, 1997 (figured I should start putting dates in here...)

Version 2.0.44 has finially been released, with lots of fixes, and
some new stuff that I finially gave in on.  For all you fans of the
various fvwm hacks that keep showing up (fvwm95, fvwm-xpm, etc) be
sure to check out the new optional at compile time
BorderStyle/TitleStyle/UseDecor stuff...  I'm looking for good
examples for them to put in the sample fvwm2rc files.  If anyone comes
up with some that they might like to contribute, feel free to mail
them to the fvwm mailing list.


------------------------------------------------


Figures...I just finish uploading 2.0.43 and I realize I forgot to
update the man page to go with the changes in the -f parameter

Version 2.0.42 has a problem linking under SunOS 4.1.x.  'strerror' is
undefined.  Just change the call to strerror(errno) in builtins.c to be
sys_errlist[errno] instead, for the time being.



There is also a problem with starting up without an rc file (and it
currently doesn't look for a global one either) where no borders or
menus appear.  Both will be fixed in the next release, but here's a
patch for the lockup if no ~/.fvwm2rc problem though:

There is also a problem with a change I made to how Exec works in
certain cases.  If you have any compound statements being run, you'll
need to do something like the following until I think of a good way to
resolve the problem:



Exec /bin/sh -c "cd foo;foobar"


There is one other minor problem with the Fvwm.tmpl file.  If you use
the FvwmCompilerFlags define in there, PixmapPath won't work.  Silly
little mistake on my part:

Version 2.0.41 uses a jump table (array of pointers) in place of a
switch statement to handle events.  I forgot to account for the event
numbers of the SHAPE extension, so you may get coredumps on some
platforms when using SHAPEd programs.  The following patch fixes it:

Version 2.0.40 has a problem linking on some platforms.  It may
complain about XLoadQueryFont not being defined.  Apply this patch to
makefile.h if you need to:

Version 2.0.39 has an unresolved reference 'basename' on some
platforms.  Just edit fvwm.c and remove the call to basename() if you
need to, or figure out what extra library needs to be linked in on
your system, or grab a newer version instead (RECOMMENDED).
