Subject: The new FVWM Logo competition

As one part of the upcoming 10-th birthday event of our project,
we, the FVWM developers, launch a new logo competition.

Those with artistic skills are invited to submit as many logos as they 
like given the submitted logos satisfy the logo competition rules.  
The winner will be granted with a prize and of course a honour, the logo
will be distributed together with one of the oldest living Free Software
projects.

Please read about the project and the new logo competition rules
at our site that had recently updated its web design:

Thank you for your participation,

The FVWM developers
