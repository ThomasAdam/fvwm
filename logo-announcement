Subject: New FVWM Logo competition

Hello, dear artists.
Hopefully this message will encourage you to a joyful creativity.

We, the FVWM developers, celebrate the 10-th birthday of our project in
Juny 2003 and launch our new logo competition.

Those with artistic skills are invited to submit as many logos as they
like given the submitted works satisfy the logo competition rules.
The winner will be granted with a prize and of course a honour, the logo
will be distributed together with one of the oldest living Free Software
projects.

Please read about the project and the new logo competition rules at:

Thank you for your participation,

The FVWM developers
