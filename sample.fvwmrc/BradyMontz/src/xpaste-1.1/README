	XPaste is a short X program which creates a window and displays the
contents of the Primary paste buffer in that window. I find it surprisingly
useful, and have my .twmrc set up to run xpaste whenever I click the middle
mouse button within the root window. This allows me to extend to the root 
window the concept of "pasting" a selection.
