Hi Folks,

I just wanted to announce a little contribution of my part for the
Fvwm-Window-manager. In fact, I didn't like all these different sizes
of the icons people could find everywhere, also not having a 3d look
in the icons displayed on the screen didn't please me. So I looked
around a bit and finally found some great looking icons, I also
created some of my own and included a little script for converting and
creating 3d-looking Icons. here's the README File I included.

You can find my package op:

ftp://pc50.zrz.tu-berlin.de/pub/3dpixmaps/3d_pixmaps_0.1.tar.gz

Hi Folks,           Joerg Mertin <smurphy@stardust.bln.sub.org>
                    Better use:  <joerg@pc50.zrz.tu-berlin.de>

* This is my Version 0.1 of 3d_pixmaps distribution.
  including pixmaps in 3d Look with their respective mini-pixmap

* These are not mine (Well not all). I first found a bunch, then created
my own ! This is no Commercial Product, free (For everyone to use) and
I take absolutely no warranty if anything bad happens to your system !
Like the monitor blowing up because it got too many Colours presented
a.s.o ...) ;)

* Just wanted to contribute a little bit to the fvwm-Stuff :)
In Fact, while parsing through different Unix-System, I discovered
some nice looking 3d_featured pixmaps. Unfortunatly they weren't
enough, so I decided to create some own.

* It happened to also have a 3d Template pixmap, which helped me to
create my own. Unfortunatly, I didn't manage to get the combine to
center the original pixmap onto the template, what I resolved by
resizing the original first. A bad sideeffect is, that it has some
quality losses after resizing :( If someone knows a better solution, 
let me know ;)

* To use the Make3dxpm you'll need the Marvellous Imagemagick-Package,
since the tools Make3dxpm uses are taken from there ...

* In fact, What I never liked with all the XPM's lying around, was their
different sizes so you could'nt get an arranged Desktop. So, "we" have to
decide  of a size for all icon's. I choosed 56x46 pixels, since the
Real-Good looking ones I found have this size :) and I wouldn't
destroy the good-looking by resizing them. Mini-Pixmaps are also
included from all existing pixmaps in this directory. 

* Be warned that these pixmaps let your X-Server working very hard and
it can takes almost to 1 minute to have a picture on the screen after
a startx. This on a i486-DX4-100MHz with 32 MB Ram.



TODO -
- I'm using these pixmaps (have a look at my system.fvwmrc file) on an
  16 bit Display, so it might be to much colours for 8 Bit
  displays. Unfortunatly, many programms don't want to create a
  Colourmap since many xpm's don't have a name. Have to fiddle arround a
  bit 'til I find a solution for it. When I found it, I'll reduce colour
  consumption to 50 Colours for all images.


TODO - for the Fvwm Programmers
- What I'd like the fvwm-Programmers to do is to find a way (Should be
  pretty easy though) to integrate the pixmap automatically from the
  name of the application.
  By example, instead of having: 
  +               "%mini.fvwm.xpm%FvwmConfig" Module FvwmConfig
  just insert:
  +               "FvwmConfig" Module FvwmConfig
  And fvwm knows that the pixmaps is FvwmConfig.xpm, and the mini.icon
  is mini.FvwmConfig.xpm
  This would mean a lot of Pixmap renaming, but at least, if you
  already got some pixmaps for an application, fvwm recognises it
  right away without users to fiddle around for integrating new
  pixmaps. Wouldn't it be a good idea ?

  
For any hints and good-ideas, email me ;)
Have fun ...
