Charles Hines:
Contributed some patches in the early days of fvwm.  Later took
over maintenance of fvwm-2.0.x after Rob Nation, the original
author of fvwm, decided to "retire".  Made a fair amount of
changes and fixes, and incorporated changes and fixes from
numerous people all over the net.  Did this from about August of
1995 until May of 1998 when he came to the realization that he
didn't have enough time to properly devote to it and decided to
"retire" himself, handing Brady Montz the torch.  Shortly
thereafter is when fvwm became "ruled by committee" and this
previous fvwm dictator is now happy to see fvwm surviving and
thriving with this new development methodology (and may even
contribute again himself, someday).

Dan Astoorian:
Wrote extras/fvwmperl, before X11::Fvwm (available via CPAN) made
it obsolete.

Greg J. Badros:
Substantial rewrite of fvwm-2.0.x menuing code to support
arbitrary depth menus, animated menus, Win95 look, better
logically-based shortcut keys, auto-splitting of long menus, check

primitives: animated-moves, SetEnv, fix to Echo. Improve modules:
Make FvwmM4 pass args on to m4, font-related seg-fault bug fix in
FvwmButtons.
