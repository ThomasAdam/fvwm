These are 2 small FVWM modules written in perl:

* module-example:
	Beeps, auto-raises and sends a command to terminate itself in
	one minute.
	
* module-winlist:
	Prints window names and ids to stderr and exits.
	If -x flag is given, do this in xmessage instead of stderr.

You may just run these modules in FvwmConsole using their full path.
