These are a number of small fvwm modules written in Perl:

* module-example:
	Beeps, auto-raises, auto-iconifies and auto-exits in one minute.

* module-flash:
	Shows a flash window on every page switch. Mainly for tutorial.

* module-gtkflash:
	The same using GTK+ with small additional functionality.

* module-winlist:
	Prints window names and ids to stderr and exits.
	If -x flag is given, do this in xmessage instead of stderr.

* module-gtkwinlist:
	Shows a list of windows, two columns that may be sorted by clicking
	on titles, multiple windows may be iconified/shaded. Using Perl/Gtk.

* module-tkdesker:
	A simple version of pager, does not show mini-windows or pages;
	shows only buttons, one per desk. Using Perl/Tk.

* module-trackertest:
	Creates all possible trackers and dumps their data.

You may just run these modules in FvwmConsole using their full path.
Several modules require extra Perl packages from CPAN to be installed.
