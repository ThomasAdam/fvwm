These are 2 small FVWM modules written in perl:

* module-example:
	Beeps, auto-raises and sends a command to terminate itself in
	one minute.
	
* module-winlist:
	Prints window names and ids to stderr and exits.
	If -x flag is given, do this in xmessage instead of stderr.

* module-gtkwinlist:
	Shows a list of windows, two columns that may be sorted by clicking
	on titles, multiple windows may be iconified/shaded. Using Perl/Gtk.

* module-tkdesker:
	A simple version of pager, does not show mini-windows or pages;
	shows only buttons, one per desk. Using Perl/Tk.

You may just run these modules in FvwmConsole using their full path.
The last 2 modules require extra perl modules from CPAN to be installed.
