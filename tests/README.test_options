Run the test_options script from this directory.
It will configure and build fvwm multiple times for every selected
combination of configure options.

Parameters:

  -0: build once with all options disabled/enabled (2 builds)
  -1: build once with any single option disabled/enabled (2 builds per option)
  -2: build once with any combination of two options disabled/enabled
      (n * n + n builds where n is the number of options)
  -a: all tests (2 ^ n builds)

The default is 'test_options -0 -1' since '-2' can take a very long time.

A summary logfile test_options.log is generated as well as an additional log
for each build (test_options.log.*). The names are self explaining.
