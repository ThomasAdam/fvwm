This directory contains only the hints_test.c program. To compile it
either try "make" or something like

  % gcc -g -O2 -Wall -I/usr/X11R6/include -L/usr/X11R6/lib -c hints_test.c
  % gcc -g -O2 -Wall -o hints_test hints_test.o -I/usr/X11R6/include -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11

should work.

The program does nothing: it is just a 170x100 black window. However,
using options you can set various hints (XSizeHints, XWMHints, MWM hints,
EWMH hints) on the window. Here are the options:

-min-size w h
	Set the min_width and min_height XSizeHints to w and h

-max-size w h
	Set the max_width and max_height XSizeHints to w and h

-inc-size w h
	Set the inc_width and inc_height XSizeHints to w and h

-pg geometry
	Set the program geometry and the gravity accordingly.
	geometry is a standard X geometry (not a F geometry)

-ug geometry
	Set the user geometry and the gravity accordingly.
	geometry is a standard X geometry (not a F geometry)

-input Bool
	Set the InputHint to Bool where Bool is either true or false

-focus-proto
	Respect the WM_TAKE_FOCUS protocol

-no-delete-proto
	By default the program respect the WM_DELETE_WINDOW protocol. This
	option forces the program to do not use it at all.

-wm-state state
	Set the initial wm state to state, where state can be withdrawn,
	iconic or normal

-wm-urgency
	Set the wm urgency flags

-wm-group win
	Set the window group leader to win where win can be root,
	window or the id of an window.

-transient win
	Set the WM_TRANSIENT_FOR window to win where win can be root
	or the id of an window.

-mwm-decor args
	where args is a non empty space separated list of the following
	key words: all, border, resizeh, title, menu, minimize, maximize

-mwm-func args
	where args is a non empty space separated list of the following
	key words: all, resize, move, maximize, minimize, close

-mwm-input arg
	where arg can be: modless, app_modal, sys_modal, full_app_modal

-ewmh-type type
	Set the EWMH window type to type where type can be: normal, dock,
	toolbar, desktop, menu, dialog, splash, utility
	
-ewmh-state states
	Set the EWMH window states to states where states is a non empty
	space separated list of the following key words: hidden, shaded,
	sticky, skippager, skiptaskbar, maxhoriz, maxvert, modal, staysontop,
	fullscreen

-ewmh-desktop int
	Set desktop initial state

This is just a test program there are no checking when the options
are parsed. Do not forget to use xprop and xwininfo.

Have Fun!
