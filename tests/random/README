To run this test you need zsh installed on your system (the script was written
using zsh-3.0.6 but will most likely run with any other version).

The script needs to find fvwm2 in the search path.  It then generates a list of
strings from the executable using "strings".  With this list of strings it
generates semi random config lines that are written to stdout.  It also throws
in random whitespace, punctuation and quoting characters between the words.

This output can be redirected into a file that can be used to run as the config
file for fvwm2.  While the config file is processed you may have to press a
mouse button repeatedly.

This test is meant to find coredumps and to run in conjunction with a malloc
debugger.
