This directory contains files to test fvwm (no modules) for memory leaks.

Instructions:

 - execute the shell script install.purify to copy some files needed by
   the config file to /tmp
 - copy purify.fvwm2rc over your .fvwm2rc (or execute it any way you like)
 - (re)start fvwm
 - Start the tests by using button 1 on the root.
   This brings up a menu,
   if you have a shell named "root-tail" you may want to use the menu
   to start it.
 - From the menu, pick an individual test or select "Run all tests".
 - whenever fvwm expects user input, press escape
   unless the test directs otherwise.
 - the script will terminate fvwm after completion

NOTE: you can safely ignore all error messages, beeps, ...

NOTE: This README was last updated for fvwm-2.3.29 and may be be correct.

There are comments in purify.fvwm2rc indicating missing or inadequate tests.
