Options :

FvwmTaskBarFont  : default font for the buttons
 "" SelFont:     : font for the depressed buttons (the Start button uses
                   always SelFont even if depressed)
 "" Fore & Back  : fore and back colors
 "" Geometry     : window geometry (only Y coordinate is usefull)
 "" Action	 : binds action to mouse buttons.
 "" AutoStick    : the bar automatically sticks to the top or bottom of the 
                   screen
 "" UseSkipList  : only lists windows that are not in the SkipList definition
 "" UseIconNames : use preferably the icon name instead of the full window
                   title for button label
 "" SwallowModule: same as in FvwmButtons (or GoodStuff), however, the support
                   is limited and resizing is awfull.
 "" ButtonWidth  : maximum button width (min = 32)
 "" ClockFormat  : strftime string format for the digital clock
 "" BellVolume   : volume of the bell rung for mail
 "" MailBox      : mailbox path (by default /var/spool/mail/$login_name
		   (site administrator should consider changing DEFAULT_MAIL_PATH
		    in Goodies.h if it does not reflect their system's default)
		   A value of 'None' indicates not to check for mail.
 "" StartName    : label for the start button
 "" StartMenu    : fvwm popup menu to be activated when the start button
                   is pressed
 "" StartIcon    : pixmap for the start button

...and more (see the man pages!!!)

A word about the pixmaps size: the current version only centers them on
the button, neither button resize nor pixmap resize is made if the icon is
bigger than the default button size. For the font size I'm using (12pts)
the maximum height is about 16 pixels. 

This module is based on the FvwmWinList module + win95look
