      <h1>Pydesks.py Manpage</h1>

<tt>Pydesks</tt> is a simple extension that allows you to maintain a
mnemonic mapping for desktop numbers, and to quickly switch between
desktops.  It is reminiscent of Ctwm's desktop pager.  Those who use
multiple desktops, each of a single 1x1 page, may find this succinct
interface useful.  It takes up much less screen real-estate than the
standard <tt>FvwmPager</tt>.

<p>
Note that <tt>Pydesks</tt> requires that you have Tkinter installed in
your Python interpreter, either as a static or dynamic module.

<h2>Synposis</h2>

<h3>Configuration File Options</h3>

<tt>Pydesks</tt> understands the following configuration options (in
your <tt>fvwmrc</tt> file):

<dl>
    <dt><tt>*PydesksDesk NAME NUMBER</tt>
    <dd>A desk mapping description.  <tt>Pydesks</tt> will associate
        the NAME with the desk NUMBER.  All desk mappings will be
	presented in a vertical radio button, in the order they are
	found in your configuration file.
    <dt><tt>*PydesksAutoGrow</tt>
    <dd>If present, <tt>Pydesks</tt> will automatically grow the radio
	button list when Fvwm changes to a desk number not contained
	in the <tt>*PydesksDesk</tt> mappings.  It will name the new
	desk <em>Desk N</em> where <em>N</em> is the new desk number.
    <dt><tt>*PydesksFvwmPagerKludge</tt>
    <dd>If present, <tt>Pydesks</tt> will ignore <em>Desk 10000</em>
	commands.  These are generated by <tt>FvwmPager</tt> to work
	around a timing problem which is caused by the lack of a
	single function that changes both the desk and the page.
	Without this option, you will see <em>Desk 10000</em> appear
	in the radio buttons when also using <tt>FvwmPager</tt>.
    <dt><tt>*PydesksGeometry GEOM</tt>
    <dd>Assigns the top level window the specified X geometry.
</dl>	

<h3>Operation</h3>

When you start <tt>Pydesks</tt> a small window will pop up containing
a vertical bank of radio buttons.  Each button will contain the name
of a desk defined in your desk number to desk name mappings.  By
clicking on a button, Fvwm will switch to the specified desk.  When
switched to a known desk by other means (e.g. via <tt>FvwmPager</tt>),
the current desk's radio button will be selected.  If the desk is not
part of the current mappings, a radio button may be added for the new
desk, depending on the presence of the <tt>PydesksAutoGrow</tt> flag.

<p>
Hitting <tt>Alt-q</tt> over the radio button window will cause
<tt>Pydesks</tt> to exit.

<h2>Bugs</h2>

The geometry isn't always maintained when automatically grown.

<p>
It would be nice to completely reproduce <tt>FvwmPager</tt>.

<p>
It would be nice if you could interactively edit the desk mappings,
deleting, renaming, adding desks, etc., and have them automatically
rewritten back to your <tt>fvwmrc</tt> configuration file.
