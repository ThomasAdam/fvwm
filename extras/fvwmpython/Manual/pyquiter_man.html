      <h1>Pyquiter.py Manpage</h1>

<tt>Pyquiter.py</tt> is a very simple module that uses
<a href="fvwm_man.html" target="_self">Fvwm.py</a>.  Pyquiter displays
a dialog window which asks for confirmation before quitting Fvwm.  Two
buttons are displayed, one which cancel's the dialog (this is the
default) and the other which confirms that you want to quit the window
manager.

<p>
Note that <tt>Pydesks</tt> requires that you have Tkinter installed in
your Python interpreter, either as a static or dynamic module.

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

Pyquiter has no configurable options.

<h2>Bugs</h2>

Pyquiter really should do a global server grab, forcing you to confirm
or cancel the quit, but I don't think the Tk script being used
actually supports this.

<p>
It might be nice if Pyquiter presented a list of windows that are
currently active, so that you are better informed about active windows
on non-visible pages or desks.
