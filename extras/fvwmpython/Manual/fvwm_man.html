<h2>Synposis</h2>
This is a Python module that interfaces with the Fvwm module API.  It
allows you to write Fvwm extensions in Python.  It is integrated with
Python's Tkinter module, so you can easily write extensions that
present a user interface.

<h3>Classes</h3>
<dl>
    <dt><tt>FvwmModule</tt>
    <dd>Top level class used to communicate with Fvwm.
    <dt><tt>ConfigInfo</tt>
    <dd>Class that encapsulates Fvwm module configuration lines.
    <dt><tt>PacketReader</tt>
    <dd>Class that encapsulates reading packets from Fvwm.  This is
        actually represented by a family of derived classes, one per
        packet type, the base class of which is <tt>Packet</tt>
</dl>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<dl>
    <dt><tt>PipeReadError</tt>
    <dd>Indicates an error while reading the file descriptor from Fvwm.
    <dt><tt>SynchronizationError</tt>
    <dd>Indicates that a partial, incomplete, or invalid packet was read
        from the Fvwm file descriptor.
</dl>

<h3><a name="modfuncs">Module Functions</a></h3>
<dl>
    <dt><tt>error(msg, exit=None, flag='ERROR')</tt>
    <dd>This function writes an error message to the module's standard
	error.  Typically, this will get displayed on the system
	console.  <tt>msg</tt> must be a string.  Optional
	<tt>exit</tt> is an integer; if provided, this function will
	call <tt>sys.exit()</tt> with this value.  Optional
	<tt>flag</tt> is a prefix to use when printing the message.
    <dt><tt>debug(msg)</tt>
    <dd>Print a debugging message on standard error.  As above,

<h2>Class Descriptions</h2>

<h3><tt>FvwmModule</tt></h3>

The <tt>FvwmModule</tt> class is the main class for interaction with
Fvwm.  In typically usage, you will derive from this class and your
applications will instantiate only one of these objects.  The class
provides an interface for sending commands to Fvwm, and a framework
for dispatching callbacks on packets read from Fvwm.  It also provides
conveniences for setting the Fvwm event mask, and for getting module
configuration lines and the window list.

<p>
There are two complimentary frameworks for creating callbacks.  The
first uses derived class methods, while the second uses registered
functions with the latter always taking precedence.

<p>
Registration of callbacks is pretty simple.  You simply call
<tt>FvwmModule.register()</tt> giving the packet name (as a string),
and a callback function object.  The function should take two
arguments, the first is the <tt>FvwmModule</tt> instance, and the
second is the <a href="#pktobj" target="_self">packet object</a>.
There is a complimentary
<tt>FvwmModule.unregister()</tt> function.

<p>
<a name="pktnames">
For derived class methods, the names of the Fvwm packet types are used
as keys for lookup</a>.  The mapping between packet names and method
names is pretty straightforward (the listing of packet names is
described in the <em>Fvwm Module Interface</em> Document).  For a
given packet name, the leading <tt>M_</tt> is removed, and the
remaining symbol is stripped of underscores and converted to
mixed-case format.  For example, when the <tt>M_ICON_LOCATION</tt>
packet was received, the method <tt>IconLocation()</tt> would be called.
Derived class methods take two arguments as well: <tt>self</tt>, and
the <a href="#pktobj" target="_self">packet object</a>.

<p>
If no registered callback and no derived method is found to handle a
given packet, the method <tt>FvwmModule.unhandled_packet()</tt> is
called, which also takes <tt>self</tt> and the
<a href="#pktobj" target="_self">packet object</a>.
You can, of course, override this in your derived class.

<p>
The <tt>FvwmModule</tt> class has some other useful methods and public
instance variables:
<dl>
    <dt><tt>send(command, window=WINDOW_NONE, cont=1)</tt>
    <dd>Sends a command string to Fvwm.  Optional <tt>window</tt>
        specifies the window to apply the command to (note that this
        is the application's window ID; e.g. the <tt>top_id</tt> in
        the <a href="tracker_man.html">Tracker</a> module's
        <tt>Window</tt> class).  Optional
        <tt>cont</tt> is the continuation flag (see the Fvwm module
        documentation for details).
    <dt><tt>set_mask(mask=None)</tt>
    <dd>Sets the Fvwm event mask for the module.  Optional
        <tt>mask</tt> can be a bit-wise OR of
	<a href="#modvars" target="_self"><em>Context</em>
	values</a>.  By default, the event mask is calculated
	automatically by searching for all implemented packet handler
	methods and registered callback handlers.

    <dt><tt>start()</tt>
    <dd>Start reading packets and dispatching on packet types.  If the
	<tt>Tkinter</tt> module has been imported, and at least one
	widget has been created, this will start the Tk mainloop.  Note
        that currently, recursive mainloops with Tk doesn't seem to be
	working properly.
    <dt><tt>stop()</tt>
    <dd>Stop reading packets.
    <dt><tt>get_configinfo()</tt>
    <dd>Returns a <tt>ConfigInfo</tt> instance which encapsulates the
	configuration lines from Fvwm.
    <dt><tt>get_windowlist()</tt>
    <dd>Sends the <tt>Send_WindowList</tt> command to Fvwm and reads
	all resulting packets, collating them into a
	<a href="tracker_man.html">Tracker</a> instance, which is
	returned.

    <dt><tt>program</tt>
    <dd>Contains <tt>argv[2]</tt> of the module's initial command line.
    <dt><tt>configfile</tt>
    <dd>Contains <tt>argv[3]</tt> of the module's initial command line.
    <dt><tt>appcontext</tt>
    <dd>Contains <tt>argv[4]</tt> of the module's initial command line.
    <dt><tt>wincontext</tt>
    <dd>Contains <tt>argv[5]</tt> of the module's initial command line.
    <dt><tt>args</tt>
    <dd>Contains a list of the <tt>argv[6:]</tt>
	initial command line arguments.
</dl>

<h3><tt><a name="pktobj">Packet<a></tt></h3>

The <tt>Packet</tt> class is not directly accessible by your code.
Instead, instances of it (actually of classes derived from it) are
passed into the callback functions and methods.  Packet classes are
named in a manner similar to derived method names, except that the
word <tt>Packet</tt> is appended to the name,
e.g. <tt>AddWindowPacket</tt>.  Usually the actual packet class name
isn't important.

<p>
All packet objects have a common collection of public instance
variables:
<dl>
    <dt><tt>pktlen</tt>
    <dd>Total length of the packet, including the header, in unsigned
	longs.
    <dt><tt>timestamp</tt>
    <dd>The last timestamp received from the X server, expressed in
	milliseconds (note that this is <em>not</em> the Unix time!).
    <dt><tt>msgtype</tt>
    <dd>The packet type, as an integer.
    <dt><tt>pkthandler</tt>
    <dd>The <a href="#pktnames" target="_self">
	packet <em>callback</em> name</a> used to select a derived
	class method for dispatch.
</dl>

<p>

	</dl>
</dl>

<h3>ConfigInfo</h3>

<tt>FvwmModule.get_configinfo()</tt> returns an instance of this
class, which provides a convenient encapsulation of Fvwm module
configuration lines.  Instances of <tt>ConfigInfo</tt> have the
following methods:

<dl>
    <dt><tt>get_infolines(re=None)</tt>
    <dd>Returns all the configuration lines, as a list.  With optional
	<tt>re</tt> parameter, only those lines
	<tt>regex.match</tt>'ing the regular expression are returned.
	Since the match starts at the beginning of the line, you do
	not need to include the `*' character at the beginning of the
	regular expression.
</dl>

and the following public instance variables:

<dl>
    <dt><tt>iconpath</tt>
    <dd>The value of <tt>IconPath</tt>.
    <dt><tt>pixmappath</tt>
    <dd>The value of <tt>PixmapPath</tt>.
    <dt><tt>clicktime</tt>
    <dd>The value of <tt>ClickTime</tt>.
</dl>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

There are several problems (IMO) with Fvwm's module API and functional
interface.  Notably there isn't a way to set both the desk and page
with one command, and this introduces ugly update timing conditions in
modules (such as the <tt>FvwmPager</tt>).

<p>
The nastiest problem that I've not been able to work around is that
Fvwm likes to send pixel values for various color parameters.  This
isn't very useful to Tk based modules because Tk only understands X11
color names and there seems to be no way to convert from a pixel value
(e.g. 0 - 255 on an 8 bit framebuffer) to the X11 color,
<em>without</em> using an X11 Python module.  Such a module does
exist, but it's not distributed with Python and it's a shame to have
to install and import that module just to decipher color
parameters from Fvwm.

<p>
I wish instead that Fvwm would send an X11 color name.
Understandably, sending the color's name as a string would introduce a
variable width field in some packets.  Instead the RGB style name
could be used; e.g. <tt>#RRGGBB</tt> (Tk allows up to 16 bits per
intensity, so <tt>#RRRRGGGGBBBB</tt> would have to be passed).
