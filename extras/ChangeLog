	* FvwmWharf/Wharf.h: Made icon_info.depth a signed char, because
	it is sometimes compared with -1.

	* FvwmDebug/FvwmDebug.h (setvbuf): Checks for HAVE_SETVBUF and
	SETVBUF_REVERSED.

	* FvwmTaskBar/Makefile.am (INCLUDES):
	* FvwmPipe/Makefile.am (INCLUDES):
	* FvwmDebug/Makefile.am (INCLUDES):
	* FvwmConsole/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Added xpm_CFLAGS, since
	xpm.h is included by fvwmlib.h.

	* FvwmScript/FvwmScript.c: Change DEBUG to MEMDEBUG where it masks
	the heap debugging library references, so you don't have to have
	it to compile fvwm2 with -DDEBUG.

1998-11-04  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* FvwmConsole/FvwmConsole.h: Remove bogus Linux system header
	includes.
