     FvwmConsole allows the user to type fvwm  commands  into
     xterm,  and  have  them executed immediately. These commands
     are usually specfified in the .fvwm2rc file, or are bound  to
     menu/mouse  items  as  specified in that file. This tools is
     particularly useful for testing new configuration ideas,  or
     for implementing temporary changes to your environment.

     GNU readline library is called to edit command line.
     A perl script is supplied as an alternative command editor
     for those who don't have the readline library.

     Any comments will be appreciated.
