<command>
<cmdsynopsis>
	<arg choice='plain'>Maximize [flags] [bool] [horizontal[p]] [vertical [p]]</arg>
</cmdsynopsis>
</command>


<para>Without its optional arguments (or if the
<emphasis remap='I'>bool</emphasis>
bit has the value "<fvwmopt cmd="Maximize" opt="toggle"/>")
<emphasis remap='B'>Maximize</emphasis>
causes the window to alternately switch from a full-screen size to
its normal size.  To force a window into maximized (normal) state
you can use a "<fvwmopt cmd="Maximize" opt="True"/>" or "<fvwmopt cmd="Maximize" opt="False"/>" value for the
<emphasis remap='I'>bool</emphasis>
argument.</para>

<para>With the optional arguments
<emphasis remap='I'>horizontal</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='I'>vertical</emphasis>,
which are expressed as percentage of a full screen, the user can
control the new size of the window.  An optional suffix
'<fvwmopt cmd="Maximize" opt="p"/>'
can be used to indicate pixels instead of percents of the screen
size.  If horizontal is greater than 0 then the horizontal
dimension of the window is set to
<emphasis remap='I'>horizontal</emphasis>*screen_width/100.
If the value is smaller than 0 the size is subtracted from the
screen width, i.e. -25 is the same as 75.  If
<emphasis remap='I'>horizontal</emphasis>
is "grow", it is maximized to current available space until
finding any obstacle.  The vertical resizing is similar.  If both
horizontal and vertical values are "grow", it expands vertically
first, then horizontally to find space.  Instead of the horizontal
"grow" argument, "growleft" or "growright" can be used
respectively "growup" and "growdown".
The optional
<emphasis remap='I'>flags</emphasis>
argument is a space separated list containing the following
key words:
<emphasis remap='I'>ewmhiwa</emphasis>, <emphasis remap='I'>growonwindowlayer</emphasis>, <emphasis remap='I'>growonlayers</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='I'>screen</emphasis>.
<fvwmopt cmd="Maximize" opt="ewmhiwa"/>
causes fvwm to ignore the <acronym>EWMH</acronym> working area.
<fvwmopt cmd="Maximize" opt="growonwindowlayer"/>
causes the various grow methods to ignore windows with a layer
other than the current layer of the window which is maximized.
The
<fvwmopt cmd="Maximize" opt="growonlayers"/>
option must have two integer arguments.  The first one is the
minimum layer and the second one the maximum layer to use.
Windows that are outside of this range of layers are ignored by
the grow methods.  A negative value as the first or second
argument means to assume no minimum or maximum layer.
<fvwmopt cmd="Maximize" opt="screen"/>
must have an argument which specifies the Xinerama screen on which
to operate.
It can be 'p' for the primary screen, 'c' for the current
screen (containing the mouse pointer), 'g' for the global screen
or the screen number itself (counting from zero).  This option is
only useful with multiple Xinerama screens.</para>

<para>Here are some examples.  The following adds a title-bar button to
switch a window to the full vertical size of the screen:</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/> 0 4 A Maximize 0 100
</programlisting>

<para>The following causes windows to be stretched to the full width:</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/> 0 4 A Maximize 100 0
</programlisting>

<para>This makes a window that is half the screen size in each
direction:</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/> 0 4 A Maximize 50 50
</programlisting>

<para>To expand a window horizontally until any other window is found:</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/> 0 4 A Maximize 0 grow
</programlisting>

<para>To expand a window until any other window on the same or a higher
layer is hit.</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/> 0 4 A Maximize growonlayers $[w.layer] -1 grow grow
</programlisting>

<para>To expand a window but leave the lower 60 pixels of the screen
unoccupied:</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/> 0 4 A Maximize 100 -60p
</programlisting>

<para>Values larger than 100 can be used with caution.</para>
