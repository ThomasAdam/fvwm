Performs
<emphasis remap='I'>command</emphasis>
(typically
<fvwmref cmd="Focus"/>)
on a window in the given direction which satisfies all
<emphasis remap='I'>conditions</emphasis>.
Normally, the center of the currently focused window or the
context window in which the command was invoked is taken as the
starting point.  Lacking such a window, or when the
<emphasis remap='I'>FromPointer</emphasis>
option is given, the current position of the pointer is taken as
the starting point.  The
<emphasis remap='I'>direction</emphasis>
may be one of "North", "NorthEast", "East", "SouthEast", "South",
"SouthWest", "West", and "NorthWest".  Which window
<emphasis remap='B'>ScanForWindow</emphasis>
selects depends first on the position along the primary axis given
by
<emphasis remap='I'>direction</emphasis>.
If any windows have the exact same coordinate along the primary
axis, the secondary direction is used to order the windows.  The
<emphasis remap='I'>direction2</emphasis>
may be one of the same set of values as
<emphasis remap='I'>direction</emphasis>.
If
<emphasis remap='I'>direction2</emphasis>
is not perfectly perpendicular to
<emphasis remap='I'>direction</emphasis>,
ScanForWindow returns a failure.  When using ScanForWindow
repeatedly with the same arguments, it is guaranteed that all
windows matching the conditions will eventually be found.  If the
focus reaches a limit along the primary axis, it will wrap around
to the opposite side.  Returns -1 if an invalid direction was
given.
See <fvwmref sect="conditionals" opt="conditions" name="Conditions"/> section for a list of conditions.</para>
