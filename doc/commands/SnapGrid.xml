<para>During an interactive move a window or icon is positioned such
that its location (top left corner) is coincident with the nearest
grid point. The default
<emphasis remap='I'>x-grid-size</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='I'>y-grid-size</emphasis>
setting are both 1, which is effectively no grid all.  An
interactive move with both
<emphasis remap='B'>SnapGrid</emphasis> and <fvwmref cmd="SnapAttraction"/>
results in the window being moved to be adjacent to the nearest
window border (if within snap proximity) or grid position.  In
other words, the window moves the shortest distance possible to
satisfy both
<emphasis remap='B'>SnapGrid</emphasis> and <fvwmref cmd="SnapAttraction"/>
Note that the x and y coordinates are not coupled.  For example, a
window may snap to another window on the x axis while snapping to
a grid point on the y axis.  Calling this command without
arguments reinstates the default settings.</para>
