<command>
<cmdsynopsis>
	<arg choice='plain'>Wait window</arg>
</cmdsynopsis>
</command>

<para>This command is intended to be used in fvwm functions only.  It
causes execution of a function to pause until a new window matching
<emphasis remap='I'>window</emphasis>
appears.  This can be a window's name, class, or resource string.
It may contain the wildcards '*' and '?', which are matched in the
usual Unix filename manner.  This is particularly useful in the
"InitFunction" if you are trying to start windows on specific desktops:</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="AddToFunc"/> InitFunction
 + I <fvwmref cmd="Exec"/> exec xterm -geometry 80x64+0+0
 + I Wait xterm
 + I <fvwmref cmd="GotoDesk"/> 0 2
 + I <fvwmref cmd="Exec"/> exec xmh -font fixed -geometry \
       507x750+0+0
 + I Wait xmh
 + I <fvwmref cmd="GotoDesk"/> 0 0
</programlisting>

<para>The above function starts an xterm on the current desk, waits for
it to map itself, then switches to desk 2 and starts an xmh.
After the xmh window appears control moves to desk 0.</para>

<para>Fvwm remains partially functional during a wait, but any input
from the modules is queued up and processed only after the window
appears or the command is aborted.  For example, windows can not
be focused with FvwmTaskBar or FvwmWinList during a wait.</para>

<para>You can escape from a
<emphasis remap='B'>Wait</emphasis>
pause by pressing
<emphasis remap='SM'>Ctrl-Alt-Escape</emphasis>
(where
<emphasis remap='SM'>Alt</emphasis>
is the first modifier).  To redefine this key sequence see the
<fvwmref cmd="EscapeFunc"/>
command.</para>
