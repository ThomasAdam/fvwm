<para>Combines the effects of
<fvwmref cmd="ResizeMove"/>
and
<fvwmref cmd="Maximize"/>
in a single command.  When used on a maximized window, the window
is resized and moved and is still in the maximized state
afterwards.  When used on an unmaximized window, the window is
resized and put into the maximized state afterwards.  This is
useful if the user wants to resize the window temporarily and then
return to the original geometry.  The
<emphasis remap='I'>resize-arguments</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='I'>move-arguments</emphasis>
are the same as for the
<fvwmref cmd="ResizeMove"/>
command.</para>
