<para>If the window accepts the delete window protocol a message is sent
to the window asking it to gracefully remove itself.  If the
window does not understand the delete window protocol then the
window is destroyed as with the
<fvwmref cmd="Destroy"/>
command.  Note: if the window accepts the delete window protocol
but does not close itself in response, the window is not deleted.</para>
