<command>
<cmdsynopsis>
	<arg choice='plain'>Schedule [Periodic] delay_ms [command_id] command</arg>
</cmdsynopsis>
</command>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>command</emphasis>
is executed after about
<emphasis remap='I'>delay_ms</emphasis>
milliseconds.  This may be useful in some tricky setups.  The
<emphasis remap='I'>command</emphasis>
is executed in the same context window as the
<emphasis remap='B'>Schedule</emphasis>
command.  An optional integer argument
<emphasis remap='I'>command_id</emphasis>
may be given in decimal, hexadecimal or octal format.  This id can
be used with the
<fvwmref cmd="Deschedule"/>
command to remove the scheduled command before it is executed.  If
no id is given, fvwm uses negative id numbers, starting with -1
and decreasing by one with each use of the
<emphasis remap='B'>Schedule</emphasis>
command.
Note that the
<emphasis remap='B'>Schedule</emphasis>
command and its arguments undergo the usual command line
expansion, and, when
<emphasis remap='I'>command</emphasis>
is finally executed, it is expanded again.  It may therefore be
necessary to quote the parts of the command that must not be
expanded twice.</para>

<para>Note:  A window's id as it is returned with $[w.id] can be used as
the
<emphasis remap='I'>command_id</emphasis>.
Example:</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Current"/> Schedule 1000 $[w.id] <fvwmref cmd="WindowShade"/>
</programlisting>


<para>The
<emphasis remap='B'>Schedule</emphasis>
command also supports the optional keyword
<fvwmopt cmd="Schedule" opt="Periodic"/>
which indicates that the
<emphasis remap='I'>command</emphasis>
should be executed every
<emphasis remap='I'>delay_ms</emphasis>.
Example:</para>

<programlisting>
Schedule Periodic 10000 <fvwmref cmd="PipeRead"/> '[ -N "$MAIL" ] &amp;&amp; echo \
     Echo You have mail'
</programlisting>

<para>Use the
<fvwmref cmd="Deschedule"/>
command to stop periodic commands.</para>
