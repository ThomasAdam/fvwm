Items with highest priority / most severe problems:

 - #158 (IS_NAME_CHANGED flag) Mikhael (later)
 - What should we do with #128 (bug #564)?  Can fvwm do anything
   about the window that receives the selection?
 - Do we want to set up bzip2 tarballs (#12)?  We'd have to put
   links on the downloads page then.  Definitely saves a lot of
   space (compressed with bzip2 -9):
     fvwm-2.3.16.tar.gz:  1533662 bytes
     fvwm-2.3.16.tar.bz2: 1188684 bytes

========== Closed recently: ======================================

 14) Figure out what the problem with Amaya is.
     [reported on 3-Jun-1999 by Rob Urban <urban@spielwiese.de>]
     [still unreproducible; not relevant for 2.4]
 16) Try to fix the 'netscape stuck on page' problem.
     [reported on 17-May-1999 by <jason@sdf.lonestar.org>]
     [still unreproducible; not relevant for 2.4]
 48) Finish Windoze 95 like config file.
 90) Icon distribution.
107) "Recapture" while an icon is focused takes several seconds.
     [reported by Mikhael; confirmed by Dominik]

     'xload -g 50x50'.

     gaps after page switching (with IconBox).
133) Bug #602 (window placement w/ 2.3.15)
140) Remove "Layer" command?  Instead, the "Layer" styles
     can be applied immediately w/o Recapture.
     [3 votes against vs 1 vote for removing]
     [maybe after 2.4]
141) Remove "MoveSmoothness" command?  I wrote it back when
     window motion was very jerky due to excessive network
     traffic, but I guess it's not very useful.
142) Remove copyright disclaimers from individual files
     (smaller tarball).
     [saves only 15k tarball size; not worth the effort]
145) Modules lose focus when a Netscape transient is opened
     (ClickToFocus).
148) Losing focus when entering root window bug.
     [reported by Elliot Sowadsky on 29-Dec-1999]
     [suggested fix: Lenience style... does not help]

161) Rename MovedButton3 condition to PlacedByButton3.

========== Closed: ===============================================

 3)  Add link to fvwm cats page to web page.
 4)  Add link to Mikhael' wm-icons page.
 5)  Update the links on our home page.

     [rejected]
 11) Add FvwmKb module?
     [delayed until after 2.4]

     [bug #184 reported by Michael Hughes <mhughes@bridge.com>]
     [no bug; doesn't happen for 2.2 and up]
 19) Fix: KFM windows stay on top of normal fvwm windows.
 20) Check why no icon can be set for Eterm.
     [reported on 8-May-1999 by Amir Chossrow Akhavan <amir@phy.ucsf.EDU>]
     [no fix? or should we rather break 'xterm +ai'?]
 21) Fix the bug with eterm and transparent background (I think rxvt has
     the same problem.
     [Eterm bug fixed, rxvt doesn't work very well with transparent
     background. I've reported to the rxvt mailing list]
 22) Investigate bug #290. (windows cannot be raised over others sometimes).
     [mail thread from April; confirmed by me (Dominik)]
     [fixed; there is a new style and the behaviour is a bit more intuitive]
 23) Check if bug #312 is still there.
 24) Investigate bug #314.
 25) Investigate dying pager on desk-to-desk transfers (bug #358 et al.)
     [fixed; only in 2.2.2, caused by missing X error handler]
 26) Investigate bug #315. (Recapture doesn't work perfectly for changing the
     default decor).
     [mainly a documentation problem; man page was updated]
 27) Check if bug #334 is still a problem.
 28) Investigate FvemEvent core dumps.
     [fixed in 2.2.3, no bug in 2.3.4]
 29) Fix the pager bugs I reported recently.

 41) Fix hanging fvwm when moving GNOME menu bars (bug #395).
 42) Get bitmap icons working again.
 43) Several pager bugs (bug #379).
 44) Fix TaskBar crash caused by latest patch in RemoveButton().
 45) Remove the web pages from the distribution.
 46) Titlebars should not inherit the pixmap from the border style.
 47) Verify the TaskBar clock update problem.
     [given up; I think I could reproduce the problem - it was a
     configuration mistake, but the reporter didn't care to answer
     if my suggestion helped; Dominik]
 49) Implement a 'H'old trigger for complex functions.
 50) Implement a 'ButtonGeometry' option for FvwmButtons.
 51) Fix constraining the window size when a window is maximized or
     larger than MaxWindowSize when mapped.
 52) Allow to resize in client resize increment steps.
 53) Decide what to do with overlapping moved icons.
     [will be ignored]

 55) FvwmGtk can't be killed with 'KillModule'.
 56) Mini icons may overlap menu titles.

     [use Restart --dont-preserve-state]
 59) Get Raise/Lower of transients straight.
     [duplicate of item 54]
 60) Make MaxWindowSize a style (don't release a command that will
     change anyway).
 61) Get SidecPics working again.
 63) Fix stacking order in pager.
 64) Install the new web pages.
 65) Fix "maximize true ..." when a window is already maximized.

 67) Add a Windoze95 like screenshot to the web page.
 68) Investigate 'Xlib: sequence lost' message.
     [went away with a newer snapshot]
 69) Fix window moving. Several people have reported that moving windows
     is slow or the windows don't follow the pointer well. This is really
     a big problem.
 70) Fix resize. On one hand it's not nice that you can drag the window
     border off screen, on the other hand it doesn't hurt if the shadow
     of the border is not on screen.
 71) Fix drawing of window titles.
 72) Finish implementing colour sets for modules.
     [item split up]
 73) Remove 'panel' feature from FvwmButtons and re-implement it in a
     less disruptive way.

     [rejected]
 80) Implement colour sets in FvwmScript
 81) Change the way in which fvwm 'posts' menus with a click.
 82) Introduce a 'transient' option for FvwmButtons. This is needed
     to replicate the old panel behaviour.
 83) Fix FvwmIconMan crashes introduced by colour set support(?)
     [doesn't happen anymore]
 84) Implement colour sets in FvwmBacker.
 85) Add 'geometry' panel option in FvwmButtons.
     I think it's not worth the effort because it's similarly
     complicated as the menu position hints if I want to do it right.
     I can't see an easy solution that does something useful fast.
     [future enhancement]
 86) Finish code for setting backgrounds of other applications with
     colour sets.
 87) Describe what to do for colour set support in the module docs.
 88) Investigate 'pager out of sync' problem

 98) Allow using colours from colour sets in fvwm commands.
 99) Make HilightColors command colour set aware.
100) Remove I18N patches since author seems to have lost interest
     in finishing the patch.
     [leave it in, started to rewrite patch in a better way]
101) Finish current work on style changes w/o recapture in a
     consistent way. This doesn't necessarily mean that the
     feature has to be complete before 2.4.
102) Patch 'UseDecor' and 'UseStyle' styles and various ...Style
     commands to apply without a recapture.
     [finished except UseStyle]
103) Add recent bug reports to to-do list.
104) Fix FvwmCommandS core dumps on X server shutdown.
108) FvwmPager desk separators are not updated if their colour set
     is changed (*FvwmPagerColorset).
109) FvwmIconMan titles don't seem to work.
111) Fix position hints not working with menus invoked
     from a menu like this: 'addtomenu foo foo menu foo root c c'
112) Fix desk flipping with
       shade-iconify-move_to_other_page-deiconify-unshade
     (and equivalent bug with maximize instead of shade).
113) FvwmForm sets no class/resource.
114) FvwmIdent sets no class/resource.
115) FvwmWharf sets no class/resource.
131) Sticky windows move to the top in the pager view if the desk is
     changed.
132) Tru64 sizeof(unsigned long) problem
135) FvwmWinList doesn't handle negative geometries properly
     with TitleAtBottom.
136) Implement a FlushUpdates command to apply style changes
     within a function?
     [nope; enhanced Refresh/RefreshWindow instead]
137) Bug #550 (FvwmAuto raises after 'lower')
144) Bug #604 (ActivePlacements doesn't work if FvwmAnimate
     is running).
     [Style * DumbPlacement fixes it]
147) Investigate/fix missing windows in pager after Recapture.
     [reported by Paul (PDS) on 06-Jan-2000]
149) "date" command confuses keyboard focus.
150) Mini windows in pager can reach into adjacent pages
     because of the min size of 3x3 pixels.
151) Colours in FvwmIconMan screwed up.
154) Investigate/fix move lockups.
     [Reported by Brad]
     [did not happoen for several months; fix if it shows up again]
155) Remove busycursor configure option.
