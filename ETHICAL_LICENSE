Legally, fvwm is distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License.  However, the events following the 11th of
September, 2001 and the multinational war against Iraq that began
in March 2003, made me reconsider the wisdom of choosing this
license.  I can not ignore the fact that my work has a part in
killing people, no matter how small it may be.  After discussing
this with many people, I decided to add the following "ethical"
license.

No user of fvwm is forced to agree to the licensing terms.  But
please keep in mind that fvwm is developed by volunteers in their
free time.  Blatant violation of this license by many people will
not only demotivate me and other volunteers, reducing the quality
of fvwm, but may also end development completely.

Thank you for your attention
