	offset instead of own menu style.

Wed Feb 17 08:24:46 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* configure.in: Clear cache variables relating to
	--with-{xpm,rplay,readline}-* options so the presence of these
	libraries will always be recomputed.  This avoids the problem of
	not finding the library (or finding the wrong one) if configure is
	re-run with different options.

1999-02-17  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* configure.in: updated for 2.1.14

1999-02-16  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/bindings.c (ParseBindEntry): Specifying 'any' modifier and

1999-02-02  Hippo

	* fvwm/menus.c (PaintMenu) Rewrote DGradient/BGradient menu code to

	* INSTALL.fvwm: Added note about config.cache.  Tweaked shared
	libs information.

	* README: Mention the INSTALL.fvwm file.

1999-01-29  Hippo

	* fvwm/menus.c (PaintMenu): Fixed {D,B}Gradient's being clipped by the
	last mini-icon, fixed drawing errors with some compilers not
	auto-casting from float to int very well.

1999-01-28  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/menus.c (PaintEntry): Prevent menu titles from being hilighted
	with ActiveFore
	(MenuInteraction): fixed bug that caused menus ('Menu' command) being
	popped down immediately if the pointer moved even a single pixel.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (GetMenuStyleIndex):
	(NewMenuStyle): Changed PrepopMenus -> PopupImmediately and
	PrepopMenusOff -> PopupDelayed

	* fvwm/menus.c (MenuInteraction):
	* fvwm/menus.h: changed PrepopMenus -> PopupImmediately

1999-01-27  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/menus.c (MenuInteraction): check for expose events first to
	ensure the menu is drawn properly before navigating

	* fvwm/menus.c (DoMenusOverlap): fixed gradient menu drawing bug
	(MenuInteraction):
	(PopDownAndRepaintParent):

	instead: simpler and fixes a drawing bug

1999-01-27  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	* modules/FvwmPager/x_pager.c:  Backed out the change to prevent
	sending focus to No Input windows regardless of the Lenience setting.
	The change to send FVWM a Focus command had the effect of causing
	unwanted viewport changes. We'll revisit this after 2.2; the proper
	fix will probably involve expanding the message protocol to send the
	wmhints, so that the module can determine whether the window should
	get focus.

1999-01-26  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	* fvwm/events.c:  Changed the stacking order chain rebuilder to seek
	out the icon window's position in the stacking order, not the app
	window frame's position, if a window is iconic (and the icon is not
	being suppressed).

	* fvwm/misc.c:  Corrected the new RaiseWindow logic to recognize the
	case of an icon window's being at the top of the stacking chain. This
	corrects the problem of not being able to raise an app window above
	an icon that has been specifically raised.

1999-01-26  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	* fvwm/fvwm.c:  Changed default from ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage
	to ActivePlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage. We'll all be the happier for it.

	* fvwm/placement.c:  Fixed improper placement of windows that start
	iconic, but are not StartsOnPage, and use ActivePlacement. This fix
	reverts to the former handling - the icon is simply dumped onto the
	current desk/page without going through any fancy placement logic or
	expecting the user to place the window interactively.

1999-01-25  Steven Michael ROBBINS  <stever@bongo.cs.mcgill.ca>

	* configure.in: Forget values cached for libreadline; it messes up
	detecting whether termcap or ncurses is needed.

1999-01-25  Dan Espen  <dane@mk.bellcore.com>

	* libs/Grab.c: Make the grab count externally visible.

	* fvwm/module.c (PositiveWrite): Don't send iconify message to
	lock on send modules while fvwm2 has the server grabbed.  This
	fixes an hang during recapture while FvwmAnimate is running.

1999-01-23  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: Update the section that said there was no way to
	map a window to someplace other than the current viewport.

1999-01-20  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* INSTALL.fvwm: Document new install-strip issue and workaround.

	* Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Require automake 1.4.  Needed
	now that the VERSION and PACKAGE undefs are removed.

	(NoneFunc): check for NULL pointer added
	(CurrentFunc): check for NULL pointer added
	(DirectionFunc): check for NULL pointer added

	* fvwm/functions.c (ExecuteFunction): check for NULL pointer added
	(find_func_type): check for NULL pointer added

1999-01-19  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* README: Update new URLs; a few spelling corrections; specify
	that the fvwm-workers maintain FVWM now.

1999-01-19  Steven Michael ROBBINS  <stever@jeff.cs.mcgill.ca>

	* README: Changed "care and feeding" info from Brady Montz to the
	Fvwm Workers.

	* INSTALL.fvwm: Updated the info & verified the URLs for the three
	optional libraries (xpm, rplay, and readline).  Other small
	wording changes.

	* configure.in:
	* */Makefile.am: Make sure xpm_CFLAGS preceeds X_CFLAGS, so that
	the include directory for xpm-includes is searched ahead of the
	system's X11 include directory.

	* acconfig.h: Removed #undefs for VERSION & PACKAGE; autoheader
	from autoconf 1.13 now generates them automatically.

1999-01-19  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/menus.c (MenuInteraction): fixed keyboard shortcut bug

1999-01-18  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

1999-01-16  Steven Michael ROBBINS  <stever@jeff.cs.mcgill.ca>

	* configure.in: Nuke cached values before retrying check for
	libreadline (using -lncurses rather than -ltermcap).

Sat Jan 16 03:14:31 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Moved ANNOUNCE, BUGS, DEVELOPERS, FAQ, TODO, and Y2K-Compliance
	from top-level directory to docs.

	* tests: Created directory; put in script to test combinations of
	build options.
	* tests/purify: Created directory; this holds docs and scripts
	helpful for running purify on the source code.  This is not
	distributed in the .tar.gz files.

Fri Jan 15 22:10:18 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: Corrected the search sequence for startup files.

	* BUGS: updated for 2.2

1999-01-14  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: If readline doesn't work with termcap, see if it
	works with ncurses (some installations are built against
	ncurses).

	* INSTALL.fvwm: Updated to document cpp issues.
	Updated to document shared library / -R issues.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (FreeMenuStyle):
	(NewMenuStyle):

	* libs/XResource.c: Now includes config.h to get function
	prototypes, and removed const from XrmOptionDescRec.  Both changes
	are to placate the compiler.

Sun Jan 10 22:13:10 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* fvwm/module.c (make_packet): Removed dead code.

1999-01-08  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Check to see if we have sigaction() or not.
	Test for atexit() and include atexit.c if it's not there.  If it's
	not there, test for on_exit() instead.

	* fvwm/fvwm.c (main): Remove USE_POSIX/USE_BSD stuff; they're not
	autoconf-y.  Instead, use check for sigaction(); if it doesn't
	exist we'll fall back to the "traditional" signal().

	* fvwm/misc.h: Use autoconf to find the proper return type for
	signal handler function DeadPipe().
	* fvwm/module.c (DeadPipe): Define proper return type for DeadPipe()
	* libs/Module.c (ReadFvwmPacket): Use proper return type for DeadPipe()

	* libs/atexit.c: New file.  Add for systems which don't have
	atexit() (SunOS has on_exit(); if any others use different things
	they'll have to be handled too).

Thu Jan  7 21:44:43 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* configure.in: Add checks for system headers that are required
	before using AC_FUNC_SELECT_ARGTYPES.  Workaround for autoconf
	2.13 bug.

1999-01-06  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Update to autoconf 2.13.
	Use new AC_FUNC_SELECT_ARGTYPES to get select() argtypes.
	If we can't find cpp, only print a warning.
	Move testing of xpm, readline, etc. until later in the script so
	we have a chance to find any necessary extra libs before then.
	Remove the search for socket, since it wasn't accurate (on
	Solaris, for example, -lsocket needs -lnsl too) and will be found
	by X_EXTRA_LIBS anyway.

	* fvwm/events.c (My_XNextEvent): Updated to use new #defines for
	select().

1999-01-06  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	* fvwm/misc.c (RaiseWindow):  Disabled Matthias Clasen's patch to keep
	from raising StaysOnTop windows above override_redirect windows: there
	are situations where non override_redirect windows raise themselves
	without FVWM's knowledge, and it breaks normal raising in these cases.
	It's on the right track, but more work is needed post-2.2.

1999-01-06  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/events.c (GetContext): fixed fixed fix for fix (made
	MouseFocusClickRaises work again).

	are not distributed.

1999-01-05  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	* fvwm/misc.c (RaiseWindow):  Added Matthias Clasen's patch to keep
	from raising StaysOnTop windows above override_redirect windows; fixed
	the stacking order chain reorg to keep StaysOnTop windows at the
	beginning of the chain.

1999-01-05  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* NEWS: Updated with new configure options.

	* acinclude.m4 (smr_CHECK_LIB): A few tweaks: don't print out
	extra lines; make sure $with_xxx is set properly.

	* configure.in: Added output section to the end, mainly to make a
	missing XPM lib more obvious.
	Added a new XPM check grabbed from XEmacs, which verifies we have
	a "new enough" version of XPM.
	Add a new check for the type of arguments to select(); whether we
	like fd_set* or require int*.
	Allow the user to specify a location for cpp with --with-cpp.
	If cpp can't be found, stop immediately.

	* fvwm/events.c (My_XNextEvent): Replace __hpux check with select
	arg check from configure.

1999-01-03  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/menus.c (MenuInteraction): fixed various bugs in drawing
	gradient menus when overlapping the parent menu. Fixed bug with
	hilighting an item before the menu was painted (it stayed hilighted
	with gradient menus and Hilight3D).

	(MenuInteraction): fixed a *bad* bug with MenuStyles. At several places
	I used the style of the submenu instead of the menu itself.

	* FAQ:
	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: Some comments on gradient menus

	* fvwm/menus.c (DoMenusOverlap): fixed PopupOffsetAdd in MenuStyle

1999-01-02  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/menus.c (SetMenuItemSelected): fixed slow XGetImage (?) Why does
	fetching a XYPixmap take so long while ZPixmaps are grabbed instantly?

	* fvwm/events.c (HandleButtonPress): removed unnecessary code

	* fvwm/fvwm.h: switched context defines to hex (instead of decimal)

	* fvwm/add_window.c (AddWindow): backed out a patch that caused a mouse
	binding problem

1998-12-31  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/events.c (My_XNextEvent): applied cleanup patch by Chris Rankin

1998-12-30  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/menus.c (MakeMenu): fixed font-change bug with menus: If a menu
	has a continuation and then the font is changed (to a smaller one) the
	continuations are not recalculated (i.e. the menus are too short).

	assigned twice in the same function: duplicate code removed)

	* FAQ: updated question 1. Miaow.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (SetMenuStyle): fixed TrianglesRelief option

1998-12-28  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/move.c (moveLoop): Position in feedback window relative to
	current page, not the whole desktop

1998-12-24  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/builtins.c (MatchesContitionMask): rewrote the contition so that
	a mere mortal can read it (costs a few bytes though).

	* fvwm/builtins.c (MatchesContitionMask):
	* fvwm/icons.c (DeIconify):
	(Iconify): bugfix for transient iconification bug

1998-12-22  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/builtins.c (menu_func): default-action does not need to be
	quoted anymore. Another few lines of code saved :)

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: updated Popup syntax, corrected Menu syntax

	* fvwm/builtins.c (staysup_func):
	(popup_func):
	(menu_func): merged popup_func and staysup_func to menu_func. Popup
	menus have a default action now too. It is invoked if the user presses
	the button to invoke the popup menu but releases it before
	DOUBLECLICK_TIMEOUT expired. With keys it works the same way as with
	Menu. And it is less code too :-)

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: corrected PopupDelay menu style documentation

	* ------ end of my changes for MenuStyle rework ------

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: a little cleanup on 'Style'

1998-12-21  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/menus.c (PaintEntry): Why the hell were the popup triangles
	placed dynamically? An offset of five pixels from the right edge of
	the menu siply has to do. The dynamic placement might put the tringle
	over the text of the menu item.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (DestroyMenuStyle): it is possible to destroy a used
	menu style. Menus using it revert back to the default menu style

1998-12-20  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* libs/Parse.c (GetTokenIndex): repaired behaviour with (len == 0)

	* fvwm/menus.c:

	* fvwm/builtins.c (ReadMenuFace): static now
	(FreeMenuFaceStyle): changes for new MenuStyle syntax
	(ReadMenuFace): fixed coredump: Pixmap/TiledPixmap without pixmap name
	(ReadMenuFace): fixem meory leaks
	(ReadMenuFace): fixed coredump: incomplete gradients freed

	* fvwm/menus.h: new structures MenuLookStyle and MenuFeelStyle,
	modified MenuFace.

	* fvwm/fvwm.c (InitVariables):
	* fvwm/screen.h (ScreenInfo): added StdGC, StdReliefGC and StdShadowGC.

	'DefaultColors'

	* fvwm/builtins.c (ApplyIconFont):
	(LoadIconFont):
	(ApplyWindowFont):
	(LoadWindowFont): moved calculations based on the font into separate
	functions so that 'SetDefaultFont' may do this too.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (ChangeMenuStyle): fixed memory leaks in parsing
	(DestroyMenuStyle): cleaned up

1998-12-18  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* libs/Parse.c (GetQuotedString):
	(SkipQuote): new functions for ease of parsing.

	* ------ beginning of my changes for MenuStyle rework ------

Sun Dec 20 09:34:19 1998  DanEspen  <dje@blue>

	* fvwm/functions.c (func_config): Oops, put EdgeThickness command
	in right place in command table.  Really thought I tested that.

	* fvwm/fvwm.h: Remove #defines for PAN_FRAME_THICKNESS
	and SCROLL_REGION.

	* fvwm/misc.h: Add prototype for setEdgeThickness, and a macro
	for the args to any fvwm2 command.

	* NEWS:
	* fvwm/fvwm2.1:
	* fvwm/functions.c (func_config):
	* fvwm/virtual.c (setEdgeThickness): Add new command, "EdgeThickness
	0 | 1 | 2".

1998-12-18  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	* fvwm/placement.c (PlaceWindow): Removed checks for IconicState
	property that prevented StartsOnPage from working when an app was
	started with the -iconic argument.

	accident.

1998-12-18  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/bindings.c (ParseBindEntry): fixed older patch to combine
	mouse and key binding parsing. Dos this prevent the key binding

	* fvwm/module.c:
	* fvwm/fvwm.c: applied signal handler patches by Chris Rankin

	boundaries not possible if EdgeScroll 0 0 was used.

	* fvwm/menus.c: backed out my prvious patch for 'recursive' menus and
	did it another (much simpler) way. Now we ignore the popup completely
	if it is already mapped but has a parent different from the current
	menu.

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: documented syntax changes for SetMenuStyle,
	sorted manpage

	* fvwm/menus.c:
	* fvwm/menus.h:

	menu style have been eliminated.

1998-12-16  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* libs/fvwmlib.h: Added #defines to handle the __attribute__ GCC
	extensions.  Use them normally (see the GCC manual for details)
	and they'll be removed harmlessly if you're not using an
	appropriate version of GCC.

	* DEVELOPERS: Added some notes about the automake $TAR issues.

1998-12-16  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: Updated manpage for SetMenuStyle: 'next' does not exist
	anymore.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (Recapture): Recapture now swallows all mouse and
	keyboard events (and a few others). This speeds up things dramatically.

1998-12-15  Dan Espen  <dane@mk.bellcore.com>

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1 (Note): Document the way menustyle affects the placement
	of the feedback windows.

1998-12-15  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/builtins.c (MatchesContitionMask): tried to fix transient icons
	bug with Next [iconic]

	* libs/System.c (getostype): Fixed uname bug for Solaris 2.6. Is this
	guaranteed to work with any every system? or could automake do
	something for us there?

	* fvwm/menus.c (MenuInteraction):
	(FPopupMenu): fixed last patch (mrDynamicPrev not set, menu not popped
	down when an item is selected)

	* fvwm/menus.c:
	(do_menu):
	(MenuInteraction):
	(PopDownMenu): Fixed bug: A menu containing itself as a 'Popup' was
	unmapped when the popup item was entered and left. Fixed this by
	introducing a new parameter to PopDownMenu: a MenuRoot to search for
	mrPopup before actually popping down.

1998-12-14  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/events.c (HandleConfigureRequest): added ' - Tmp_win->bw' that

	* fvwm/read.c (ReadSubFunc): the piperead string was set as the last
	read filename

	* fvwm/module.c (executeModule): removed useless code:
	  if(args[nargs] != NULL)
	    free(args[nargs]);
	when args[nargs] is guaranteed to be NULL

	* fvwm/fvwm.c (SetRCDefaults): added missing comma after "SetMenuStyle"
	default

	* fvwm/builtins.c (SetMenuStyle):
	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: removed SetMenuStyle ... next. The menuface option can
	be applied to any menu style. I don't understand what this was good for
	anyway since when you specified 'next', the menu style itself
	(mwm/fvwm/win) was undefined.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (SetMenuStyle1): removed unused code

	* fvwm/misc.h: changed signature of DisplaySize

	* fvwm/events.c (HandleConfigureRequest):
	* fvwm/add_window.c (AddWindow): changed signature of ConstrainSize

	parameters to DoResize/ConstrainSize, moved static globals last_...
	into DisplaySize and introduced a parameter to reset them.

	called from outside resize.c!)

	* fvwm/add_window.c:
	* fvwm/resize.c:
	* fvwm/events.c: even more debug code

	* fvwm/resize.c (MoveOutline): removed duplicate code

1998-12-09  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/builtins.c (ReadButtonFace): Removed MiniIcons memory leak fix.
	No chance to get this stable without a rewrite of large parts of code.

	some colours to be wrong

1998-12-09  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	* fvwm/builtins.c (DeferExecution):
	* fvwm/resize.c (resize_window):
	* fvwm/move.c (Keyboard_shortcuts):
	(moveLoop): patch to Keyboard_shortcut (was used for other things than
	move/resize which didn't work well).

1998-12-08  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/menus.c (menuShortcuts): fixed coredump with isgraph

	* fvwm/resize.c:
	Removed globals constrainx/constrainy. Calculate them in ConstrainSize
	when needed. This fixes the growing windows bug. Had to change the
	signature of ConstrainSize.

	* fvwm/resize.c (resize_window):
	(DoResize):
	(ConstrainSize):
	* fvwm/add_window.c (AddWindow):

	* fvwm/builtins.c (ReadButtonFace): fixed memory leak (?)
	(SetEnv): fixed memory leak

	* fvwm/windows.c (do_windowList): DestroyMenu called as soon as

	* archive/purify/purify.fvwm2rc: Comment out things that cause
	heap corruption, until they can be fixed.

	* fvwm/icons.c (Iconify): Initialize winattrs to empty to avoid
	possible uninitialized memory reads in your_event_mask.

	* fvwm/colors.c (AllocLinearGradient): Added an error message for
	invalid npixels.

1998-12-01  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	strings when deleting the binding.

	* fvwm/windows.c (do_windowList): Make sure to free func, if not
	already freed.  Use tfunc to contain the menu title, not tlabel
	(which is fixed-size).

	* libs/Parse.c (GetOnePercentArgument): Free the token returned
	from GetNextToken().

	* fvwm/builtins.c (ReadButtonFace): Free the perc array.

	* fvwm/fvwm.c (DestroyFvwmDecor): Free the Decor font if one was
	allocated.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (SetMenuStyle): Free the StdFont before
	resetting it.

	* libs/Parse.c (DoGetNextToken): Cast chars to unsigned before

	* fvwm/builtins.c (SetClick):
	* fvwm/fvwm.c (InitVariables):
	(main):
	More speedup with ClickTime during startup. A negative value will
	becone positive when the event loop is entered (before that the user
	cannot give input anyway).

	* fvwm/fvwm.h:
	* fvwm/fvwm.c: added global flag fFvwmInStartup. This is set to False
	when the event loop is entered.

1998-11-28  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* TODO: updated

	* fvwm/events.c: reindented some code
	(HandleConfigureRequest): Phew, after a 10 hour debug session I was
	finally able to surround and bag the xterm/active icon/resize bug.
	Xterm sends a configure request to resize the icon pixmap window, but
	HandleConfigureRequest dealt with the icon window only. Now what was
	this fuzz about growing windows bugs? Bring 'em on :-[
	(HandleEnterNotify): removed garbage (old ifdef).
	(GetContext): a little speedup

1998-11-27  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	or token

	* fvmw/**: applied patches by Tim Phipps (see below)

	(flip_focus_func): cleaned up

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: changes on FlipFocus/Focus/WindowList

	* fvwm/focus.c (SetFocus): fixed SetFocus so that calling Focus from a
	function moves the windowlist around to make the target window appears
	at the top of the windowlist.

	* fvwm/windows.c (do_windowList): Applied alt-tab/unsort windowlist fix

	* fvwm/builtins.c (DirectionFunc): fixed coredump (empty direction)

	* fvwm/functions.c (FindBuiltinFunction): Cast the return value
	for systems where bsearch() isn't declared to return void*.

	* acconfig.h: Include malloc.h if it's found, and we don't have
	STDC_HEADERS (just in case).

	* libs/ModParse.h (LFindToken):  Remove this macro.  It's not
	used, and it uses a non-standard function lfind().  Best to not
	use it at all.
	(search.h): Removed #include.

1998-11-24  Dan Espen  <dane@mk.bellcore.com>

	*   fvwm/builtins.c  (SetColorLimit):  Check    return  code  from

	* fvwm/add_window.c (AddWindow): fixed uninitialised memory read:
	attributes.background_pixmap not set.

	* libs/Parse.c (DoGetNextToken): cleaned up a bit because of the
	array bounds violation in SetGlobalOptions, but I don't believe that
	fixes it. Reformatted for further debugging.

	* fvwm/functions.c (find_func_type): a little speedup

1998-11-20  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

 	fvwm/misc.h

	* fvwm/misc.h:  moved    GetShadow,   GetHilite  prototypes  to
 	libs/fvwmlib.h

	* Added the StackingOrder rewrite

1998-11-12  Dan Espen  <dane@mk.bellcore.com>

	* Under the sample.fvwmrc directory, removed everything in the

1998-11-08  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/resize.c (resize_window):
	* fvwm/move.c (moveLoop):
	Cleaned up aborting with a mouse button:
	If the move/resize started with a button down, pressing any button
	aborts the operation. If no button was down, pressing button 1 confirms
	the operation, any other button aborts.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (SetClick):
	* fvwm/modconf.c (SendDataToModule):
	* fvwm/fvwm.c (StartupStuff): Patch to speed up (re)starting fvwm.

	value do not wait for user input. Saves some seconds during startup,
	depending on the ClickTime value in the startup file.

	* libs/Picture.c (CachePicture):
	* fvwm/modules.c (executeModule):
	fixed bugs introduced during the merge on saturday

1998-11-08  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* fvwm/module.c (executeModule): fixed memory leaks

	* fvwm/modconf.c (DestroyModConfig): fixed memory leaks

	fixes.

Sat Nov  7 02:01:41 1998  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* configure.in: Version 2.1.1 released (CVS tag = version-2_1_1)
	and current version bumped to 2.1.2.

1998-11-06  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* fvwm/Makefile.am (fvwm2_DEPENDENCIES): Add a dependency on libfvwm.a.

	* libs/Picture.c (CachePicture): Free the pathname returned by
	findIconFile().

	* libs/fvwmlib.h (DB): New debugging/logging definitions.

	* libs/debug.c: New file for a uniform debugging library.
	* libs/Makefile.am (libfvwm_a_SOURCES): Build it.

	* fvwm/fvwm.c (ResetAllButtons): Rewrote to be a bit faster.  Make
	sure we reset the button flags in addition to the rest of the button.

	* configure.in: Add missing checks for memmove(), memcpy(), and
	strchr().  Check also for malloc.h vs. stdlib.h headers, and
	change to positive check for string.h instead of strings.h--we
	want to use the former where possible.  Check for vfprintf().

	* acconfig.h: Rework definitions for memmove() and memcpy() (note
	that some systems (SunOS) have memcpy() but not memmove(), so
	check them separately).  Rework header inclusion based on
	tried-and-true methods from GNU make's configuration.

	* fvwm/menus.c (scanForPixmap): Don't define or malloc()
	save_instring unless we're going to use it
	(UGLY_WHEN_PIXMAPS_MISSING is defined).  Also, make sure to always
	free it (we had a bad memory leak here).

1998-11-05  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	* folded in StartsOnPage style modifications.

1998-11-05  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Check for the div() function (for extras/FvwmScript).
	Remove check for stdarg.h; we'd need a lot fancier config to allow
	the use of varargs.h or something else; for now assume we have it.

	* fvwm/module.c (make_vpacket): New function: creates a module
	packet from a va_list.  This is the most basic function: all
	packet creating functions will eventually call this one to (at
	least) fill in the header information.  This is the only place
	that's done, now.
	(make_packet): A variadic function that uses make_vpacket() to
	construct the packet.
	(SendPacket): A generic function to send a packet to a module.
	Rewrite to be variadic instead of taking a set number of
	arguments. Use make_vpacket() to construct the packet.
	(BroadcastPacket): Renamed from Broadcast(), and removed
	Broadcase_v() which is now redundant.  A variadic function to
	broadcast a packet to all modules.  Use make_vpacket() to
	construct the packet.  Rewrote to construct the packet first, then
	send the same one to all modules, rather than calling SendPacket()
	multiple times (each time reconstructing the same packet).
	(CONFIGARGS): New macro to provide the arguments for the Config
	packet.
	(SendConfig): Rewrote to invoke SendPacket() passing the proper
	config arguments (uses CONFIGARGS).
	(BroadcastConfig): Rewrote to invoke BroadcastPacket() passing the
	proper config arguments (uses CONFIGARGS).
	(make_named_packet): A generic function to construct a packet
	where the last item is a name (variable length string).  Takes a
	name and a variable number of arguments.  Uses make_vpacket().
	(SendName): Use make_named_packet() to construct the packet to
	send.
	(BroadcastName): Use make_named_packet() to construct the packet
	to send.  Only construct it once, then send that same data to each
	module, rather than reconstructing it each time.
	(SendMiniIcon): Use make_named_packet() to construct the packet to
	send.
	(BroadcastMiniIcon): Use make_named_packet() to construct the packet
	to send.  Only construct it once, then send that same data to each
	module, rather than reconstructing it each time.
	(send_list_func): Remove padding arguments from SendPacket()
	invocations.

	* fvwm/virtual.c (MoveViewport): Call new BroadcastPacket().
	(changeDesks): Call new BroadcastPacket().

	* fvwm/move.c (move_window_doit): Call new BroadcastPacket().

	(SetDeskSize): Call new BroadcastPacket().

	Fix errors found by Purify:

	* fvwm/module.c (SendName): Zero out the end of the message to
	avoid uninitialized memory reads.

	* fvwm/decorations.c (GetOlHints): Don't free(NULL).  This is OK
	in ANSI C, but it's not completely portable.

	* libs/Picture.c (CachePicture): Don't look past the end of
	allocated memory.
	(LoadPicture): Free pixmaps when we're done with them.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (SetMenuStyle): Free a previous font if it exists.
	(LoadIconFont): Same.
	(LoadWindowFont): Same.

	* fvwm/fvwm.c (InitVariables): Initialize Scr.IconFont.
	(InitFvwmDecor): Set TitleHeight and the font pointer since
	otherwise they might be used uninitialized (in LoadWindowFont).

1998-11-05  Steven Michael ROBBINS  <stever@jeff.cs.mcgill.ca>

	* libs/XResource.c (MergeCmdLineResources): DEC's compiler claims
	that a '&' in front of the array "default_opts" is ignored, so I
	removed it.

	* libs/System.h: Removed.
	* libs/System.c: Removed mygethostname(), replaced with
	gethostname.c from some GNU utils package.  Renamed mygetostype()
	to just getostype(), in parallel with gethostname().

	* libs/Strings.c: Pulled out mystrcasecmp() and mystrncasecmp() to
	their own files.

	* libs/Parse.c (PeekToken): Add const qualifier to variable 'p' to
	stop pstr from losing its constness.

	* fvwm/style.c: Cast arguments to memcpy() to placate gcc on DEC
	alpha.

	* fvwm/module.c: Explicit checks for the presence of <stdarg.h> or
	<varargs.h>.  If using <stdarg.h>, use the two-argument form of
	va_start(), otherwise the single-argument form.

	* fvwm/menus.c (menuShortcuts): Fixed parameters in call to
	XLookupString().

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: Replace references to Fvwm.tmpl with current
	equivalents.  Other fixes from Austin Donelly.

	* fvwm/functions.c (func_comp): Put const qualifiers on the
	arguments, to match requirements for bsearch().

	* fvwm/builtins.c: Moved strerror() function to libs/strerror.c.

	* libs/sleep.c: Removed and globally changed sleep_a_little() to
	usleep().

	* libs/gethostname.c:
	* libs/strerror.c:
	* libs/usleep.c:
	* libs/strcasecmp.c:
	* libs/strncasecmp.c:

	* libs/Makefile.am: Added the above files.  Each file is compiled
	into libfvwm only if the system libraries are missing the
	corresponding function.  Globally replaced the "my"-version of
	these functions with the standard one.

	* include config.h: Moved #include to the top of the file in some
	but not yet all the files that include config.h.

	* main: All main() functions return int rather than void.

	* symbols: Changed the ifdefs around header includes to read
	#if HAVE_FOO_H, rather than a maze of machine-type symbols.

	* sun_headers.h:
	* sunos_headers.h:
	* alpha_header.h: Removed all traces of these.  Removed
	declarations of system functions when a conflict noticed.

	* configure.in: Require autoconf 2.12 as prerequisite.  Changed
	version string to 2.1.1.  Added more checks.

	* acconfig.h: Code to define str[r]chr and mem{cpy,move} if not
	available.  Removed obsolete FVWM_INLINE and globally replaced
	with "inline".

	* Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Set to 1.3b, so that automake
	complains if it is too old.

	* utils/xpm-reduce.c
	* utils/xpm-reduced-rgb.txt: removed; obsoleted by a runtime
	colour reduction scheme.

1998-11-04  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* Fix problems discovered by Purify:

	* fvwm/menus.c (MenuInteraction): Don't try to call
	GetPopupOptions() until we know we're looking at a popup menu.

	* fvwm/misc.c (GetOneMenuPositionArgument): If the returned token
	is an empty string, don't try to parse it.

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1:
	* fvwm/builtins.c (stick_function):
	* fvwm/move.c (move_window_doit):

	* modules/FvwmEvent/FvwmEvent.c: Fixed rplay build problem

	* modules/FvwmEvent/Makefile.in (mkinstalldirs):
	Added missing rplay library to link options

	* fvwm/menus.c (FPopupMenu):
	Fixed broken left menus with mwm/noanimation style when near the
	right edge of screen.
