	Be more ICCCM 2 compliant by applying the aspect ratio to
	size - base_size if the base_size is explicitly given.

	* fvwm/add_window.c (GetWindowSizeHints): completely rewritten.
	It now modifies the hints in the following way: ensure that
	1 <= inc, 0 <= base, 1 <= min <= max. It uses the follwing
	defaults: 1 for inc, min or 0 for base, base or 1 for min,
	MAX_WINDOW for max, NorthWest for gravity. PAspect is unset
	if the aspect ratios are broken. Apart from that, the flags are
	not changed. The override_size style is now handled here as well.

	* fvwm/fvwm.c (Done): rework how restarting is done under SM. The
	new scheme should not leak files and should not introduce
	unwanted checkpoints.

	We do the following now:

	1) Change the current state in .fvwm_restart
           and add a pointer to the previous session save file
	   to .fvwm_restart.
	2) Change the SmRestartCommand and SmDiscardCommand
	   to refer to .fvwm_restart and change the SmRestartStyleHint
           to Immediately.
        3) Exit, the SM starts us again, restoring the current state
           from .fvwm_restart
        4) The new fvwm finds the pointer to the session save file
	   and changes the SM properties back to their previous values.

	* fvwm/menus.c (menuShortcuts): removed C++-style comment.

	* acconfig.h (alloca stuff): moved to @BOTTOM@ section, because it

	always maps the window on the current page.
	(ButtonStyle):

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1 (OPTIONS): document -replace and possible problems.

	* fvwm/move.c (moveLoop): only set window_being_moved for
	opaque moves, since setting it for rubberband moves makes

	* fvwm/functions.c (DeferExecution):
	(ExecuteFunction): added some debugging code to force a coredump if
	tmp_win is accessed in functions that don't use DeferExecution (which
	is illegal: if they need a window they have to make sure they got one).
	(expand): added 'noexpand' command prefix

	* fvwm/functions.c (DeferExecution): Check *tmp_win for non-NULL
	instead of tmp_win. Caused a coredump.

1999-02-07 Michael Han <mikehan@best.com>

	* fvwm/menus.c (menuShortcuts): Changed the hotkey handler from a flat
	once-over the menu to a "smarter" search that locates the next match
	and distinguishes between unique and non-unique hotkeys, doing a
	MENU_NEWITEM selection for non-uniques and retaining existing behavior
	for unique hotkeys.
	(AddToMenu): Commented out checks to prevent binding of duplicate
	hotkeys for what I think are obvious reasons.
	(FHotKeyUsedBefore): Noted that this function is now

1999-03-29  Matthias Clasen  <clasen@mathematik.uni-freiburg.de>

	* fvwm/misc.c (RaiseWindow):

1999-03-29  Hippo

	* fvwm/{builtins,colors,fvwm,icccm2,menus}.c: All GC's are now created
	from Scr.NoFocusWin which could have a non-default Visual is somebody

	creating another hidden window.

1999-03-29  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@gmx.de>

	variables, and expands + to be the previous value of the path.

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: rewrote ImagePath and ModulePath entries to
	document the '+' expansion.

	and FVWM_LIBDIR to this variable and removed the special build
	rules for builtins.c, fvwm.c, and read.c; the special rules

	while keeping their stacking order; I hope this helps with
	Exceed and native windows. Someone with access to an Exceed
	X Server has to replace the XFree vendor id by the Exceed
	vendor id - I don't know it.

	* configure.in (EXCEED_HACK): New flag to protect the above hack.
	It defaults to `off'.

1999-03-12  Steven Michael ROBBINS  <stever@jeff.cs.mcgill.ca>

	restore FvwmBorder style look.  Resize handles are now InputOnly
	windows and all border drawing happens in FvwmWindow->frame. Less code
	and makes "BorderStyle DGradient" feasible.
	* libs/Graphics.c: fixed memory leak

Fri Mar 12 08:51:09 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* libs/Graphics.c (RelieveWindowGC): replaced dynamic array size

	* vms/*: files specific to the VMS port, courtesy of Fabien Villard.

	* fvwm/module.c (executeModule): put ifdef around exit() if child
	fails to exec the module binary.  Apparently VMS doesn't actually
	spawn a child process unless the exec() call succeeds.  Calling
	exit after fork() returns 0 will exit the parent!  Search for
	executables ending with EXECUTABLE_EXTENSION, and optionally
	remove the extension before exec().

	* fvwm/fvwm.c (main): put ifdef around setting close-on-exec for
	the X11 file descriptor.  DecWindows returns an event flag instead
	of a file descriptor in the fd field of the Display structure.

	* acconfig.h: add preprocessor symbols HAVE_X11_FD,
	FORK_CREATES_CHILD, EXECUTABLE_EXTENSION, and
	REMOVE_EXECUTABLE_EXTENSION to support the above.  All are set to
	suitable values for unix semantics.

Tue Mar  9 22:14:25 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@osric.bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* extras: removed.  Copied former 'extra' modules FvwmCommand,
	FvwmConsole, FvwmDebug, FvwmScript, FvwmTaskBar, and FvwmWharf to

	(author's documentation says it is "braindead" and he "discourages
	its use"), FvwmGoodStuff (obsoleted by FvwmButtons), FvwmPipe
	(similar functionality is obtained using FvwmCommand), fvwmperl
	and fvwmpython.

	* extras/ChangeLog: added to end of modules/ChangeLog.

Tue Mar  9 18:00:22 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@osric.bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* configure.in (readline): check for readline/history.h, rather
	than readline/readline.h.  Some packages install the latter, but
	not the former, but both are required if FVWM is to use readline.
	Also tell user why we are checking for readline twice.

1999-03-09  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@gmx.de>

	* fvwm/misc.h:
	* fvwm/menus.c (FindPopup):

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1 (AddToFunc): description of below patch

	the viewport. (Patch by Will French  <wfrench@interport.net>)

	* fvwm/functions.c (IsClick): first click in function does not time out
	(ComplexFunction2): Do not assume 'Move' operation if the button has
	not been released within Scr.ClickTime. Just wait for the ButtonRelease
	before making the decision.

1999-03-08  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@gmx.de>

	* fvwm/read.c (ReadFile): use F_CMD_ARGS

1999-03-08  Hippo

1999-03-07  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* fvwm/resize.c, fvwm/move.c, fvwm/virtual.c: Removed some extra ;'s
	which belongs in a prototype, not the actual function declaration.
	* fvwm/virtual.c (changeWindowsDesk): s/t/tmp_win/ .. since that's
	what the function gets as argument.

1999-03-07  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@gmx.de>

	* fvwm/functions.c (func_config): added 'Silent' command.

	* fvwm/virtual.c (setEdgeThickness):
	(scroll):

	* fvwm/add_window.c (merge_styles): fix Layer option handling.

	* fvwm/misc.c (BroadcastRestack): Reworked to send just one
	variable-size packet containing all windows. This is necessary

1999-03-06  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: Reformatted 2 paragraphs.. 'tr in the beginning of a

	* libs/System.c (searchPath): Fixed a potential off by two error.
	When space was allocated for the file name, a directory separator
	and the null termination was not taken into account. This was only
	triggered when the path only contained one directory.

Thu Mar  4 19:18:26 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1 (Iconify): re-worded to put the current syntax
	before the obsolete syntax.  I didn't really understand how
	"Iconify toggle" differs from just "Iconify".

1999-03-04  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/builtins.c (WindowShade):
	(Maximize):
	(iconify_function):

	* fvwm/colormaps.c: new global client_controls_colormaps
	for client-side InstallColormap support.
	(HandleColormapNotify):
	(InstallWindowColormaps): don't install colormaps if
	client_controls_colormaps is true.
	* fvwm/events.c (HandleClientMessage): handle wm_colormap_notify
	clientmessages by setting client_controls_colormaps.

Thu Mar  4 01:22:15 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* libs/System.c (searchPath): new function; this is most of the
	guts of the old findIconFile -- which was used to find more than
	just icons --- modules, for example!

Thu Mar  4 00:55:34 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* libs/fvwmlib.h: added prototypes for all replacement functions,
	conditionally compiled.

1999-03-03  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* fvwm/builtins.c (WindowShade): Enhanced WindowShade() to do
	animation, with the number of steps configured by the command
	'WindowShadeAnimate <steps>'
	* fvwm/builtins.c: New function 'setShadeAnim()', called by the Fvwm

	* fvwm/module.c (executeModule): put ifdef around code that closes
	pipes in child processes.

	* fvwm/misc.c: put ifdef around fvwm_msg; allows VMS port to
	define its own version of this routine.

1999-03-02  Steven Michael ROBBINS  <stever@hojpoj.cs.mcgill.ca>

	* fvwm/fvwm.h: add 'extern' keyword to Bool fFvwmInStartup,
	otherwise it is defined in each .c file that includes <fvwm/fvwm.h>

	* fvwm/modconf.c: add 'extern' keyword to PipeMask; ditto.

1999-03-02  Dan Espen  <dane@mk.bellcore.com>

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: Changed fvwm to fvwm2 everywhere I thought it should
	be changed.

1999-03-02  Matthias Clasen  <clasen@mathematik.uni-freiburg.de>

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: details about the geometry displayed

	* fvwm/add_window.c (AddWindow):
	* fvwm/move.c (AnimatedMoveAnyWindow):
	(moveLoop): insert #ifdef WINDOWSHADE ... #endif to
	make configure --disable-windowshade work.

1999-03-02  Dan Espen  <dane@mk.bellcore.com>

	* NEWS: Updated news on FvwmAnimate fonts and colors defaults.

1999-03-01  Matthias Clasen  <clasen@mathematik.uni-freiburg.de>

	* fvwm/fvwm.c (InitVariables): Change the default layers
	for StaysOnTop and StaysPut from 1 and 0 to 6 and 4.

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: Adjust the documentation of DefaultLayers.

	* fvwm/add_window.c (AddWindow): Put windows at the top of
	their layer initially.

1999-03-01 Hippo

	them.

	* fvwm/move.c: Fixed opaque/animated moves to not crash shaded windows,
	removed	#ifndef NO_ETERM_SUPPORT, might want to make it a configure
	option.

1999-02-28  Matthias Clasen  <clasen@mathematik.uni-freiburg.de>

	* fvwm/add_window.c (AddWindow): Fix a bug where unmaximizing a
	window on a non-origin page that has been restored to maximized
	state from a saved session would make it jump to a different page.

1999-02-28  Steven Michael ROBBINS  <stever@jeff.cs.mcgill.ca>

	* configure.in:
	* INSTALL.fvwm: backed out of Sat Feb 27 12:49:23 1999 change.
	Fvwm exports FVWM_MODULEDIR to the environment of subprocesses, so
	running configure in an xterm will always pick up the current
	module dir.

Sun Feb 28 11:37:22 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: removed all traces of PixmapPath from manpage.

Sun Feb 28 11:25:30 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* libs/Strings.c (stripcpy): make sure 'tmp' is valid before
	dereferencing it; there was a possible problem if function was
	passed an empty string.

Sun Feb 28 11:03:42 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* libs/Picture.h: new file.
	* libs/fvwmlib.h: moved declarations for Picture.c into Picture.h.

	* libs/Picture.c (GetIconPath,SetIconPath): the icon path variable
	is now static; these are the accessor functions.
	* libs/Picture.c (findIconFile,GetPicture,CachePicture): these
	functions now look at a single path, rather than IconPath and
	PixmapPath.  The path parameter may be NULL, in which case the
	default path -- the one set by SetIconPath() -- is used.

	* fvwm/add_window.c:
	* fvwm/builtins.c:
	* fvwm/functions.c:
	* fvwm/fvwm.h:
	* fvwm/icons.c:
	* fvwm/menus.c:
	* fvwm/misc.h:
	* fvwm/modconf.c:
	Fixes for the findIconFile(), GetPicture(), and CachePicture()
	changes.  The PixmapPath command is temporarily retained; it gives
	a warning, and then calls IconPath.

1999-02-28  Matthias Clasen  <clasen@mathematik.uni-freiburg.de>

	* AUTHORS: fix the spelling of my name.

	* libs/ModParse.c (GetArgument): fix GetArgument for quoted args.

	* fvwm/move.c (InteractiveMove): fix behaviour of
	InteractiveMove when called from a context other than a
	ButtonPress or KeyPress.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (WindowShade): fix an off-by-one error
	with shaded FvwmBorder windows.

1999-02-27  Matthias Clasen  <clasen@mathematik.uni-freiburg.de>

	* fvwm/{add_window,builtins,events,functions,fvwm,misc,
	   placement,session,style,windows}.c:
	* fvwm/{fvwm,misc}.h:
	* fvwm/fvwm2.1:
	implement a layered stacking order.

	* configure.in, acconfig.h:
	* fvwm/{session,add_window,events,fvwm,icons}.c:
	* fvwm/{fvwm,misc}.h:
	* NEWS, fvwm/fvwm2.1:
	add session management functionality ( make fvwm a client
	of a X SMP compliant session manager).

Sat Feb 27 12:49:23 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* configure.in: allow FVWM_{MODULE,CONFIG}DIR to be overridden by
	setting the corresponding environment variable before running configure.

1999-02-26  Steven Michael ROBBINS  <stever@jeff.cs.mcgill.ca>

	* auto*: removed all generated files from repository.  To
	regenerate the files, you will need to do "automake --add-missing"
	then "autoreconf".  Added .cvsignore files to ignore them during
	updates.

1999-02-26  Hippo

	* fvwm/placement.c: fixed wandering on restart/recapture caused by
	old_bw being ignored.

1999-02-25  Dan Espen  <dane@mk.bellcore.com>

	* fvwm/module.c  (HandleModuleInput): Increased max message from a
 	module from 255  to  999, needed  for FvwmForm.   Removed a little
 	redundant code.

Tue Feb 23 13:02:33 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* fvwm/module.c: include <sys/time.h> to ensure that FD_SET and
	friends are found.  My Linux system needed this, don't ask me why.

1999-02-23  Hippo

	* fvwm/builtins.c: Emulate command updates feedback window position.

	* fvwm/virtual.c: EdgeThickness command can be used at any time to
	alter the panframe windows. Panframe windows unmapped when paging to
	the end page and wrapping is disabled.  Panframe windows go right into
	the corners.

	* fvwm/windows.c: WindowList looks better when NoGeometry specified.

	* fvwm/move.c: Opaque and Animated moves send events to client.
	Transparent Eterm will stay transparent. #define NO_ETERM_SUPPORT if
	you think this is horrible.

	* fvwm/{module.{c,h},move.c} Opaque and Animated moves send module
	messages.  FvwmPager follows the move.

	* fvwm/{events,fvwm,modconf,module,read}.c: moved invocation of
	StartupStuff() from ReadSubFunc to main event loop.  Initial capture
	happens only after all command line args are finished and any modules
	that the command line args invoke.  Any number of -cmd's can be
	specified and the initial capture will happen when they have finished
	so that you don't need a recapture after a restart to get the right
	decorations. Added a timeout so that Fvwm will always do the initial
	capture.FvwmCPP & FvwmM4 can now be rewritten to exec() the subprocess
	and avoid using a Read of a temp file.

	* fvwm/{events,focus,module}.c: FOCUS_CHANGE packet has the third
	(previously useless) paramter set to denote FlipFocus/Focus.  Modules
	can now accuraetly track the internal window list order.

	* fvwm/borders.c: experimental rewrite of Sticky lines.  Use xmag to
	look at the ends. If they don't line up I think you have an Xserver
	bug.

	* fvwm/{{builtins,functions,fvwm}.c,fvwm2.1,misc.h}: XORPixmap.
	Eat this Enlightenment 8-).  Actually it's meantt to improve the
	visibility of rubberband lines in PsuedoColor displays (use Colorlimit
	first) but it looks great on TrueColor.  It plays nicely with XORValue
	and I don't think it leaks pixmaps.

1999-02-23  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* AUTHORS: updated

	* configure.in: changed version to 2.3.0

	* configure.in: Clear cache variables relating to
	--with-{xpm,rplay,readline}-* options so the presence of these
	libraries will always be recomputed.  This avoids the problem of
	not finding the library (or finding the wrong one) if configure is
	re-run with different options.

1999-02-17  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* configure.in: updated for 2.1.14

	* fvwm-2.xx.lsm: Removed.

	* fvwm-2.2.lsm: Removed.

	* fvwm.lsm: Updated (actually, deleted and renamed fvwm-2.2.lsm to
	fvwm.lsm).

1999-02-02  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Change version to 2.1.12

1999-02-02  Hippo

	* fvwm/menus.c (PaintMenu) Rewrote DGradient/BGradient menu code to
	use only integer arithmetic and draw in one pass to fix some missing
	pixel errors on some servers.

1999-02-01  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* INSTALL.fvwm: Added note about config.cache.  Tweaked shared
	libs information.

	* README: Mention the INSTALL.fvwm file.

1999-01-29  Hippo

	* fvwm/menus.c (PaintMenu): Fixed {D,B}Gradient's being clipped by the
	last mini-icon, fixed drawing errors with some compilers not
	auto-casting from float to int very well.

1999-01-28  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/menus.c (PaintEntry): Prevent menu titles from being hilighted
	with ActiveFore
	(MenuInteraction): fixed bug that caused menus ('Menu' command) being
	popped down immediately if the pointer moved even a single pixel.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (GetMenuStyleIndex):
	(NewMenuStyle): Changed PrepopMenus -> PopupImmediately and
	PrepopMenusOff -> PopupDelayed

	* fvwm/menus.c (MenuInteraction):
	* fvwm/menus.h: changed PrepopMenus -> PopupImmediately

1999-01-27  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/menus.c (MenuInteraction): check for expose events first to
	ensure the menu is drawn properly before navigating
	(FPopupMenu): fixed *badly* broken code to avoid overlapping menus
	(with and without animation).
	(DoMenusOverlap): fixed broken overlapping algorithm

	* fvwm/menus.h (MenuRoot): removed 'redrawn' flag

	* fvwm/menus.c (DoMenusOverlap): fixed gradient menu drawing bug
	(MenuInteraction):
	(PopDownAndRepaintParent):
	(PaintMenu):
	(SetMenuItemSelected): removed 'redrawn' flag. Use flush_expose
	instead: simpler and fixes a drawing bug

1999-01-27  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	* modules/FvwmPager/x_pager.c:  Backed out the change to prevent
	sending focus to No Input windows regardless of the Lenience setting.
	The change to send FVWM a Focus command had the effect of causing
	unwanted viewport changes. We'll revisit this after 2.2; the proper
	fix will probably involve expanding the message protocol to send the
	wmhints, so that the module can determine whether the window should
	get focus.

1999-01-26  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	* fvwm/events.c:  Changed the stacking order chain rebuilder to seek
	out the icon window's position in the stacking order, not the app
	window frame's position, if a window is iconic (and the icon is not
	being suppressed).

	* fvwm/misc.c:  Corrected the new RaiseWindow logic to recognize the
	case of an icon window's being at the top of the stacking chain. This
	corrects the problem of not being able to raise an app window above
	an icon that has been specifically raised.

1999-01-26  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	* fvwm/fvwm.c:  Changed default from ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage
	to ActivePlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage. We'll all be the happier for it.

	* fvwm/placement.c:  Fixed improper placement of windows that start
	iconic, but are not StartsOnPage, and use ActivePlacement. This fix
	reverts to the former handling - the icon is simply dumped onto the
	current desk/page without going through any fancy placement logic or
	expecting the user to place the window interactively.

1999-01-25  Steven Michael ROBBINS  <stever@bongo.cs.mcgill.ca>

	* configure.in: Forget values cached for libreadline; it messes up
	detecting whether termcap or ncurses is needed.

1999-01-25  Dan Espen  <dane@mk.bellcore.com>

	* libs/Grab.c: Make the grab count externally visible.

	* fvwm/module.c (PositiveWrite): Don't send iconify message to
	lock on send modules while fvwm2 has the server grabbed.  This
	fixes an hang during recapture while FvwmAnimate is running.

1999-01-23  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: Update the section that said there was no way to
	map a window to someplace other than the current viewport.

1999-01-20  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* INSTALL.fvwm: Document new install-strip issue and workaround.

	* Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Require automake 1.4.  Needed
	now that the VERSION and PACKAGE undefs are removed.

Wed Jan 20 01:13:38 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* INSTALL.fvwm: Removed doubled paragraph.

1999-02-09  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/builtins.c (CreateFlagString): corrected restptr to return NULL
	on error
	(PrevFunc): check for NULL pointer added
	(NextFunc): check for NULL pointer added
	(NoneFunc): check for NULL pointer added
	(CurrentFunc): check for NULL pointer added
	(DirectionFunc): check for NULL pointer added

	* fvwm/functions.c (ExecuteFunction): check for NULL pointer added
	(find_func_type): check for NULL pointer added

1999-01-19  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* README: Update new URLs; a few spelling corrections; specify
	that the fvwm-workers maintain FVWM now.

1999-01-19  Steven Michael ROBBINS  <stever@jeff.cs.mcgill.ca>

	* README: Changed "care and feeding" info from Brady Montz to the
	Fvwm Workers.

	* INSTALL.fvwm: Updated the info & verified the URLs for the three
	optional libraries (xpm, rplay, and readline).  Other small
	wording changes.

	* configure.in:
	* */Makefile.am: Make sure xpm_CFLAGS preceeds X_CFLAGS, so that
	the include directory for xpm-includes is searched ahead of the
	system's X11 include directory.

	* acconfig.h: Removed #undefs for VERSION & PACKAGE; autoheader
	from autoconf 1.13 now generates them automatically.

1999-01-19  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/menus.c (MenuInteraction): fixed keyboard shortcut bug

1999-01-18  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Update version number.

1999-01-17  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Test for siginterrupt().

1999-01-17  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/menus.c (PaintEntry): long separators reached into the border
	of the menu to the right, but not on the left
	(AddToMenu): AddToMenu could not be used to enter separators

1999-01-16  Steven Michael ROBBINS  <stever@jeff.cs.mcgill.ca>

	* configure.in: Nuke cached values before retrying check for
	libreadline (using -lncurses rather than -ltermcap).

Sat Jan 16 03:14:31 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Moved ANNOUNCE, BUGS, DEVELOPERS, FAQ, TODO, and Y2K-Compliance
	from top-level directory to docs.

	* tests: Created directory; put in script to test combinations of
	build options.
	* tests/purify: Created directory; this holds docs and scripts
	helpful for running purify on the source code.  This is not
	distributed in the .tar.gz files.

Fri Jan 15 22:10:18 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: Corrected the search sequence for startup files.

1999-01-16  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* BUGS: updated for 2.2

1999-01-14  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: If readline doesn't work with termcap, see if it
	works with ncurses (some installations are built against
	ncurses).

	* INSTALL.fvwm: Updated to document cpp issues.
	Updated to document shared library / -R issues.

1999-01-15  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/placement.c: Fixed SmartPlacement and CleverPlacemet failure
	to avoid sticky windows when placing SkipMapping, StartsOnPage or
	StartsOnDesk windows. Also fixed CleverPlacement bug that sometimes
	caused windows to be placed entirely outside of the virtual desktop.

1999-01-14  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/resize.c (ConstrainSize): fixed bug: moving a shaded window in
	FvwmPager screwed up the window's height

	* fvwm/fvwmdebug.c (DB_WI_ALL): fixed coredump

	* fvwm/menus.c (SetMenuItemSelected): removed malformed DBUG calls

	* fvwm/module.c (HandleModuleInput): fixed parsing with popup

1999-01-13  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/icons.c (AutoPlace): fixed a bug in icon placement (netscape 4.5
	refused to go into the icon box

1999-01-13  Steven Michael ROBBINS  <stever@jeff.cs.mcgill.ca>

	* fvwm/builtins.c (DirectionFunc): Made variable "dir" an int, to
	match return type of GetTokenIndex().

	(ReadButtonFace):
	removed ifdefs around char *PixmapPath

	* libs/Picture.c (CachePicture): introduced ifdef to handle XPM
	scanning in a central place. Should enable me to remove lots of other
	ifdefs.

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: updated MenuStyle for SidePixmap

	* fvwm/builtins.c (FreeMenuStyle):
	(NewMenuStyle):
	* fvwm/menus.c (PaintEntry):
	added support for MenuStyle sidePic

	* fvwm/builtins.c (ChangeMenuStyle): MakeMenu called only for menus
	that changed

	* fvwm/menus.c (MenuInteraction): removed f_type temporary variable

	* fvwm/misc.h (struct functions): changed 'int type' to
	'Bool func_needs_window' and 'int code' to 'short func_type'

	* fvwm/complex.c (ComplexFunction): removed reference to function code
	to determine if a window is needed. The logic uses the F_NO_WINDOW and
	F_NEEDS_WINDOW entries from functions.c now.

	* fvwm/parse.h: removed references to 'need window' logic

	* fvwm/menus.h:
	* fvwm/functions.c (func_config): removed FUNC_POPUP, FUNC_NOP,

Sun Jan 10 22:23:14 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* libs/XResource.c: Now includes config.h to get function
	prototypes, and removed const from XrmOptionDescRec.  Both changes
	are to placate the compiler.

Sun Jan 10 22:13:10 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* fvwm/module.c (make_packet): Removed dead code.

Sun Jan 10 22:11:36 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* fvwm/misc.c (GetMoveArguments):
	* fvwm/menus.c:

	* fvwm/focus.c (SetFocus):
	* fvwm/builtins.c (ButtonStyle):

	value.

Sun Jan 10 21:31:32 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* acconfig.h: Include sys/types.h and unistd.h; most code will
	benefit from the function prototypes contained therein.

	integer to pointer.

1999-01-09  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	* the stacking order ring when an app requests a change in its window's
	* place in the Great Chain of Being.
	* fvwm/misc.c (RaiseWindow): re-enabled Matthias Clasen's fix to keep
	* FVWM-managed windows from being raised above override_redirect
	* windows.

Sat Jan  9 08:20:08 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* xpmroot/*: Moved into utils directory.
	* utils/xpmroot.c: Removed dead code (yet another version of
	strcasecmp).

1999-01-07  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* **/*: Applied tons of cosmetic fixes from the Red Hat patches
	but some real bugfixes too. Sorry Paul (PDS), this one simply has
	too many files involved with trivial patches.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (DeferExecution):
	* fvwm/move.c (move_window_doit):
	* fvwm/resize.c (resize_window): applied Red Hat safety patch

	* fvwm/menus.c: applied latest patch for gradient hilighting
	(MenuInteraction): ignore unbound keys (warped back to center of item
	before).

	* fvwm/menus.c (FPopupMenu): fixed bug: menu item was not painted
	properly when warped onto (with a key press)

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: Some clarification on key bindings.

1999-01-08  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Check to see if we have sigaction() or not.
	Test for atexit() and include atexit.c if it's not there.  If it's
	not there, test for on_exit() instead.

	* fvwm/fvwm.c (main): Remove USE_POSIX/USE_BSD stuff; they're not
	autoconf-y.  Instead, use check for sigaction(); if it doesn't
	exist we'll fall back to the "traditional" signal().

	* fvwm/misc.h: Use autoconf to find the proper return type for
	signal handler function DeadPipe().
	* fvwm/module.c (DeadPipe): Define proper return type for DeadPipe()
	* libs/Module.c (ReadFvwmPacket): Use proper return type for DeadPipe()

	* libs/atexit.c: New file.  Add for systems which don't have
	atexit() (SunOS has on_exit(); if any others use different things
	they'll have to be handled too).

Thu Jan  7 21:44:43 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* configure.in: Add checks for system headers that are required
	before using AC_FUNC_SELECT_ARGTYPES.  Workaround for autoconf
	2.13 bug.

1999-01-06  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Update to autoconf 2.13.
	Use new AC_FUNC_SELECT_ARGTYPES to get select() argtypes.
	If we can't find cpp, only print a warning.
	Move testing of xpm, readline, etc. until later in the script so
	we have a chance to find any necessary extra libs before then.
	Remove the search for socket, since it wasn't accurate (on
	Solaris, for example, -lsocket needs -lnsl too) and will be found
	by X_EXTRA_LIBS anyway.

	* fvwm/events.c (My_XNextEvent): Updated to use new #defines for
	select().

1999-01-06  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	* fvwm/misc.c (RaiseWindow):  Disabled Matthias Clasen's patch to keep
	from raising StaysOnTop windows above override_redirect windows: there
	are situations where non override_redirect windows raise themselves
	without FVWM's knowledge, and it breaks normal raising in these cases.
	It's on the right track, but more work is needed post-2.2.

1999-01-06  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/events.c (GetContext): fixed fixed fix for fix (made
	MouseFocusClickRaises work again).

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: corrected the manpage on '@foo.xpm@' for AddToMenu.

	* fvwm/**: Applied updated signal handler patch by Chris Rankin

	* fvwm/events.c (GetContext): fixed button bindings on client portion
	of window.

	* archive/ChangeLog: File added to have a ChangeLog for the files that
	are not distributed.

1999-01-05  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	* fvwm/misc.c (RaiseWindow):  Added Matthias Clasen's patch to keep
	from raising StaysOnTop windows above override_redirect windows; fixed
	the stacking order chain reorg to keep StaysOnTop windows at the
	beginning of the chain.

1998-01-05  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* BUGS: Removed some fixed bugs.

1999-01-05  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* NEWS: Updated with new configure options.

	* acinclude.m4 (smr_CHECK_LIB): A few tweaks: don't print out
	extra lines; make sure $with_xxx is set properly.

	* configure.in: Added output section to the end, mainly to make a
	missing XPM lib more obvious.
	Added a new XPM check grabbed from XEmacs, which verifies we have
	a "new enough" version of XPM.
	Add a new check for the type of arguments to select(); whether we
	like fd_set* or require int*.
	Allow the user to specify a location for cpp with --with-cpp.
	If cpp can't be found, stop immediately.

	* fvwm/events.c (My_XNextEvent): Replace __hpux check with select
	arg check from configure.

	* BUGS: Documented install-strip problem.

1998-01-05  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/menus.c (FPopupMenu): force menus on screen if making them non
	overlapping moves them partially off screen.

1999-01-03  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/menus.c (MenuInteraction): fixed various bugs in drawing
	gradient menus when overlapping the parent menu. Fixed bug with
	hilighting an item before the menu was painted (it stayed hilighted
	with gradient menus and Hilight3D).

	(MenuInteraction): fixed a *bad* bug with MenuStyles. At several places
	I used the style of the submenu instead of the menu itself.

	* FAQ:
	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: Some comments on gradient menus

	* fvwm/menus.c (DoMenusOverlap): fixed PopupOffsetAdd in MenuStyle
	(only positive values worked)

	other than *

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: Removed SetMenuStyle, updated MenuStyle (and others)

	the new syntax. Dispatches a call to Old/NewMenuStyle
	* fvwm/functions.c (func_config): removed SetMenuStyle command;
	MenuStyle handles the old and the new syntax now
	* fvwm/parse.h: removed F_SET_MENUSTYLE

1999-01-02  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/menus.c (SetMenuItemSelected): fixed slow XGetImage (?) Why does
	fetching a XYPixmap take so long while ZPixmaps are grabbed instantly?

	* fvwm/events.c (HandleButtonPress): removed unnecessary code

	* fvwm/fvwm.h: switched context defines to hex (instead of decimal)

	* fvwm/add_window.c (AddWindow): backed out a patch that caused a mouse
	binding problem

1998-12-31  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/events.c (My_XNextEvent): applied cleanup patch by Chris Rankin

1998-12-30  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/menus.c (MakeMenu): fixed font-change bug with menus: If a menu
	has a continuation and then the font is changed (to a smaller one) the
	continuations are not recalculated (i.e. the menus are too short).

	* fvwm/placement.c (test_fit): applied placement fix for iconified
	windows without an icon (by Trent Piepho)

	* fvwm/add_window.c (AddWindow): fixed memory leak (tmp_win->name
	assigned twice in the same function: duplicate code removed)

	* FAQ: updated question 1. Miaow.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (SetMenuStyle): fixed TrianglesRelief option

1998-12-28  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	current page, not the whole desktop

1998-12-24  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/builtins.c (MatchesContitionMask): rewrote the contition so that
	a mere mortal can read it (costs a few bytes though).

	* fvwm/builtins.c (MatchesContitionMask):
	* fvwm/icons.c (DeIconify):
	(Iconify): bugfix for transient iconification bug

	(SetMenuStyle): introduced option 'DuobleClickTime'

	* fvwm/defaults.h: new file for default values that may be set
	throughout the code.

1998-12-22  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/builtins.c (menu_func): default-action does not need to be
	quoted anymore. Another few lines of code saved :)

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: updated Popup syntax, corrected Menu syntax

	* fvwm/builtins.c (staysup_func):
	(popup_func):
	(menu_func): merged popup_func and staysup_func to menu_func. Popup
	menus have a default action now too. It is invoked if the user presses
	the button to invoke the popup menu but releases it before
	DOUBLECLICK_TIMEOUT expired. With keys it works the same way as with
	Menu. And it is less code too :-)

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: corrected PopupDelay menu style documentation

	* ------ end of my changes for MenuStyle rework ------

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: a little cleanup on 'Style'

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1 (Note): updated manpage for FvwmAnimate/FvwmEvent

1998-12-21  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/menus.c (PaintEntry): Why the hell were the popup triangles
	placed dynamically? An offset of five pixels from the right edge of
	the menu siply has to do. The dynamic placement might put the tringle
	over the text of the menu item.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (DestroyMenuStyle): it is possible to destroy a used
	menu style. Menus using it revert back to the default menu style

1998-12-20  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* libs/Parse.c (GetTokenIndex): repaired behaviour with (len == 0)

	* fvwm/menus.c:
	DELAY_POPUP_MENUS macro removed

	(MenuInteraction): fixed bug: mouse movement considered only if moved
	in x and y direction by more that three pixels

	* fvwm/resize.c (DisplaySize):
	* fvwm/add_window.c (AddWindow):
	* fvwm/builtins.c:

	removed dependencies to menu code

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: documented DefaultFont command
	updated syntax for IconFont and WIndowFont

	* fvwm/builtins.c (ReadMenuFace): static now
	(FreeMenuFaceStyle): changes for new MenuStyle syntax
	(ReadMenuFace): fixed coredump: Pixmap/TiledPixmap without pixmap name
	(ReadMenuFace): fixem meory leaks
	(ReadMenuFace): fixed coredump: incomplete gradients freed

	* fvwm/menus.h: new structures MenuLookStyle and MenuFeelStyle,
	modified MenuFace.

	* fvwm/fvwm.c (InitVariables):

	(ScreenInfo): new hasIconFont and hasWindowFont

	* fvwm/parse.h:
	* fvwm/functions.c (func_config): Added 'DefaultFont' and
	'DefaultColors'

	* fvwm/builtins.c (ApplyIconFont):
	(LoadIconFont):
	(ApplyWindowFont):
	(LoadWindowFont): moved calculations based on the font into separate
	functions so that 'SetDefaultFont' may do this too.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (ChangeMenuStyle): fixed memory leaks in parsing
	(DestroyMenuStyle): cleaned up

1998-12-18  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* libs/Parse.c (GetQuotedString):
	(SkipQuote): new functions for ease of parsing.

	* ------ beginning of my changes for MenuStyle rework ------

Sun Dec 20 09:34:19 1998  DanEspen  <dje@blue>

	* fvwm/functions.c (func_config): Oops, put EdgeThickness command
	in right place in command table.  Really thought I tested that.

	* fvwm/fvwm.h: Remove #defines for PAN_FRAME_THICKNESS
	and SCROLL_REGION.

	* fvwm/misc.h: Add prototype for setEdgeThickness, and a macro
	for the args to any fvwm2 command.

	* NEWS:
	* fvwm/fvwm2.1:
	* fvwm/functions.c (func_config):
	* fvwm/virtual.c (setEdgeThickness): Add new command, "EdgeThickness
	0 | 1 | 2".

1998-12-18  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	* fvwm/placement.c (PlaceWindow): Removed checks for IconicState
	property that prevented StartsOnPage from working when an app was
	started with the -iconic argument.

1998-12-18  Dan Espen  <dane@mk.bellcore.com>

	* fvwm/move.c (moveLoop): Remove some fprintfs left behind by
	accident.

1998-12-18  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/bindings.c (ParseBindEntry): fixed older patch to combine
	mouse and key binding parsing. Dos this prevent the key binding
	problem?

1998-12-17  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/module.c:
	* fvwm/fvwm.c: applied signal handler patches by Chris Rankin

	* fvwm/move.c (moveLoop): fixed bug: moving windows over page
	boundaries not possible if EdgeScroll 0 0 was used.

	* fvwm/menus.c: backed out my prvious patch for 'recursive' menus and
	did it another (much simpler) way. Now we ignore the popup completely
	if it is already mapped but has a parent different from the current
	menu.

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: documented syntax changes for SetMenuStyle,
	sorted manpage

	* fvwm/menus.c:
	* fvwm/menus.h:
	* fvwm/builtins.c (ReadMenuFace): implmented visual_style for menus
	that should fix the 'menuface' bug. all traces of the former 'next'
	menu style have been eliminated.

1998-12-16  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* libs/fvwmlib.h: Added #defines to handle the __attribute__ GCC
	extensions.  Use them normally (see the GCC manual for details)
	and they'll be removed harmlessly if you're not using an
	appropriate version of GCC.

	* DEVELOPERS: Added some notes about the automake $TAR issues.

1998-12-16  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: Updated manpage for SetMenuStyle: 'next' does not exist
	anymore.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (Recapture): Recapture now swallows all mouse and
	keyboard events (and a few others). This speeds up things dramatically.

1998-12-15  Dan Espen  <dane@mk.bellcore.com>

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1 (Note): Document the way menustyle affects the placement
	of the feedback windows.

1998-12-15  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/builtins.c (MatchesContitionMask): tried to fix transient icons
	bug with Next [iconic]

	* libs/System.c (getostype): Fixed uname bug for Solaris 2.6. Is this
	guaranteed to work with any every system? or could automake do
	something for us there?

	* fvwm/menus.c (MenuInteraction):
	(FPopupMenu): fixed last patch (mrDynamicPrev not set, menu not popped
	down when an item is selected)

	* fvwm/menus.c:
	(do_menu):
	(MenuInteraction):
	(PopDownMenu): Fixed bug: A menu containing itself as a 'Popup' was
	unmapped when the popup item was entered and left. Fixed this by
	introducing a new parameter to PopDownMenu: a MenuRoot to search for
	mrPopup before actually popping down.

1998-12-14  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/events.c (HandleConfigureRequest): added ' - Tmp_win->bw' that

	* NEWS: Ditto.

	Released fvwm 2.1.3 beta (CVS tag version-2_1_3).

1998-12-13  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/read.c (ReadSubFunc): the piperead string was set as the last
	read filename

	* fvwm/module.c (executeModule): removed useless code:
	  if(args[nargs] != NULL)
	    free(args[nargs]);
	when args[nargs] is guaranteed to be NULL

	* fvwm/fvwm.c (SetRCDefaults): added missing comma after "SetMenuStyle"
	default

	* fvwm/builtins.c (SetMenuStyle):
	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: removed SetMenuStyle ... next. The menuface option can
	be applied to any menu style. I don't understand what this was good for
	anyway since when you specified 'next', the menu style itself
	(mwm/fvwm/win) was undefined.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (SetMenuStyle1): removed unused code

	* fvwm/misc.h: changed signature of DisplaySize

	parameters to DoResize/ConstrainSize, moved static globals last_...
	into DisplaySize and introduced a parameter to reset them.

	called from outside resize.c!)

	* fvwm/add_window.c:
	* fvwm/resize.c:
	* fvwm/events.c: even more debug code

	* fvwm/resize.c (MoveOutline): removed duplicate code

	LeaveNotify was found on the queue.

1998-12-10  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/move.c (et al.): Applied updated SnapAttraction patch but put

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: Clarify the uses and abuses of the Exec function.

1998-12-09  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/builtins.c (ReadButtonFace): Removed MiniIcons memory leak fix.

	some colours to be wrong

1998-12-09  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	* fvwm/resize.c (resize_window):
	* fvwm/move.c (Keyboard_shortcuts):
	(moveLoop): patch to Keyboard_shortcut (was used for other things than
	move/resize which didn't work well).

1998-12-08  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/menus.c (menuShortcuts): fixed coredump with isgraph

	* fvwm/resize.c:
	Removed globals constrainx/constrainy. Calculate them in ConstrainSize
	when needed. This fixes the growing windows bug. Had to change the

	(SetEnv): fixed memory leak

	* fvwm/windows.c (do_windowList): DestroyMenu called as soon as

	through the loop.

	* fvwm/menus.c (DestroyMenu): Free the menu name string.

	cannot give input anyway).

	* fvwm/fvwm.h:
	* fvwm/fvwm.c: added global flag fFvwmInStartup. This is set to False
	when the event loop is entered.

1998-11-28  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* TODO: updated

	* fvwm/events.c: reindented some code
	(HandleConfigureRequest): Phew, after a 10 hour debug session I was
	finally able to surround and bag the xterm/active icon/resize bug.
	Xterm sends a configure request to resize the icon pixmap window, but
	HandleConfigureRequest dealt with the icon window only. Now what was
	this fuzz about growing windows bugs? Bring 'em on :-[
	(HandleEnterNotify): removed garbage (old ifdef).
	(GetContext): a little speedup

1998-11-27  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	(flip_focus_func): cleaned up

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: changes on FlipFocus/Focus/WindowList

	function moves the windowlist around to make the target window appears
	at the top of the windowlist.

	* fvwm/windows.c (do_windowList): Applied alt-tab/unsort windowlist fix

	* fvwm/builtins.c (DirectionFunc): fixed coredump (empty direction)

	* acconfig.h: Include malloc.h if it's found, and we don't have
	STDC_HEADERS (just in case).

	* libs/ModParse.h (LFindToken):  Remove this macro.  It's not
	used, and it uses a non-standard function lfind().  Best to not
	use it at all.
	(search.h): Removed #include.

1998-11-24  Dan Espen  <dane@mk.bellcore.com>

	*   fvwm/builtins.c  (SetColorLimit):  Check    return  code  from

	* fvwm/resize.c (resize_window):
	* fvwm/move.c (moveLoop):
	Cleaned up aborting with a mouse button:
	If the move/resize started with a button down, pressing any button
	aborts the operation. If no button was down, pressing button 1 confirms
	the operation, any other button aborts.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (SetClick):
	* fvwm/modconf.c (SendDataToModule):
	* fvwm/fvwm.c (StartupStuff): Patch to speed up (re)starting fvwm.

	value do not wait for user input. Saves some seconds during startup,
	depending on the ClickTime value in the startup file.

	* libs/Picture.c (CachePicture):

Sat Nov  7 02:01:41 1998  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* configure.in: Version 2.1.1 released (CVS tag = version-2_1_1)
	and current version bumped to 2.1.2.

1998-11-06  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* fvwm/Makefile.am (fvwm2_DEPENDENCIES): Add a dependency on libfvwm.a.

	* libs/Picture.c (CachePicture): Free the pathname returned by
	findIconFile().

	* libs/fvwmlib.h (DB): New debugging/logging definitions.

	* libs/debug.c: New file for a uniform debugging library.
	* libs/Makefile.am (libfvwm_a_SOURCES): Build it.

	* fvwm/fvwm.c (ResetAllButtons): Rewrote to be a bit faster.  Make
	sure we reset the button flags in addition to the rest of the button.

	* configure.in: Add missing checks for memmove(), memcpy(), and
	strchr().  Check also for malloc.h vs. stdlib.h headers, and
	change to positive check for string.h instead of strings.h--we
	want to use the former where possible.  Check for vfprintf().

	* acconfig.h: Rework definitions for memmove() and memcpy() (note
	that some systems (SunOS) have memcpy() but not memmove(), so
	check them separately).  Rework header inclusion based on
	tried-and-true methods from GNU make's configuration.

	* fvwm/menus.c (scanForPixmap): Don't define or malloc()
	save_instring unless we're going to use it
	(UGLY_WHEN_PIXMAPS_MISSING is defined).  Also, make sure to always
	free it (we had a bad memory leak here).

1998-11-05  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>

	* folded in StartsOnPage style modifications.

1998-11-05  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Check for the div() function (for extras/FvwmScript).
	Remove check for stdarg.h; we'd need a lot fancier config to allow
	the use of varargs.h or something else; for now assume we have it.

	* fvwm/module.c (make_vpacket): New function: creates a module
	packet from a va_list.  This is the most basic function: all
	packet creating functions will eventually call this one to (at
	least) fill in the header information.  This is the only place
	that's done, now.
	(make_packet): A variadic function that uses make_vpacket() to
	construct the packet.
	(SendPacket): A generic function to send a packet to a module.
	Rewrite to be variadic instead of taking a set number of
	arguments. Use make_vpacket() to construct the packet.
	(BroadcastPacket): Renamed from Broadcast(), and removed
	Broadcase_v() which is now redundant.  A variadic function to
	broadcast a packet to all modules.  Use make_vpacket() to
	construct the packet.  Rewrote to construct the packet first, then
	send the same one to all modules, rather than calling SendPacket()
	multiple times (each time reconstructing the same packet).
	(CONFIGARGS): New macro to provide the arguments for the Config
	packet.
	(SendConfig): Rewrote to invoke SendPacket() passing the proper
	config arguments (uses CONFIGARGS).
	(BroadcastConfig): Rewrote to invoke BroadcastPacket() passing the
	proper config arguments (uses CONFIGARGS).
	(make_named_packet): A generic function to construct a packet
	where the last item is a name (variable length string).  Takes a
	name and a variable number of arguments.  Uses make_vpacket().
	(SendName): Use make_named_packet() to construct the packet to
	send.
	(BroadcastName): Use make_named_packet() to construct the packet
	to send.  Only construct it once, then send that same data to each
	module, rather than reconstructing it each time.
	(SendMiniIcon): Use make_named_packet() to construct the packet to
	send.
	(BroadcastMiniIcon): Use make_named_packet() to construct the packet
	to send.  Only construct it once, then send that same data to each
	module, rather than reconstructing it each time.
	(send_list_func): Remove padding arguments from SendPacket()
	invocations.

	* fvwm/virtual.c (MoveViewport): Call new BroadcastPacket().
	(changeDesks): Call new BroadcastPacket().

	* fvwm/move.c (move_window_doit): Call new BroadcastPacket().

	* fvwm/misc.c (Destroy): Call new BroadcastPacket().
	(RaiseWindow): Call new BroadcastPacket().

	* fvwm/icons.c (AutoPlace): Call new BroadcastPacket().
	(DeIconify): Call new BroadcastPacket().
	(Iconify): Call new BroadcastPacket().

	* fvwm/events.c (HandleFocusIn): Call new BroadcastPacket().
	(HandlePropertyNotify): Call new BroadcastPacket().
	(HandleMapNotify): Call new BroadcastPacket().
	(HandleConfigureRequest): Call new BroadcastPacket().

	* fvwm/builtins.c (WindowShade): Call new BroadcastPacket().
	(SetDeskSize): Call new BroadcastPacket().

	Fix errors found by Purify:

	* fvwm/module.c (SendName): Zero out the end of the message to
	avoid uninitialized memory reads.

	* fvwm/decorations.c (GetOlHints): Don't free(NULL).  This is OK
	in ANSI C, but it's not completely portable.

	* libs/Picture.c (CachePicture): Don't look past the end of
	allocated memory.
	(LoadPicture): Free pixmaps when we're done with them.

	* fvwm/builtins.c (SetMenuStyle): Free a previous font if it exists.
	(LoadIconFont): Same.
	(LoadWindowFont): Same.

	* fvwm/fvwm.c (InitVariables): Initialize Scr.IconFont.
	(InitFvwmDecor): Set TitleHeight and the font pointer since
	otherwise they might be used uninitialized (in LoadWindowFont).

1998-11-05  Steven Michael ROBBINS  <stever@jeff.cs.mcgill.ca>

	* libs/XResource.c (MergeCmdLineResources): DEC's compiler claims
	that a '&' in front of the array "default_opts" is ignored, so I
	removed it.

	* libs/System.h: Removed.
	* libs/System.c: Removed mygethostname(), replaced with
	gethostname.c from some GNU utils package.  Renamed mygetostype()
	to just getostype(), in parallel with gethostname().

	* libs/Strings.c: Pulled out mystrcasecmp() and mystrncasecmp() to
	their own files.

	* libs/Parse.c (PeekToken): Add const qualifier to variable 'p' to
	stop pstr from losing its constness.

	* fvwm/style.c: Cast arguments to memcpy() to placate gcc on DEC
	alpha.

	* fvwm/module.c: Explicit checks for the presence of <stdarg.h> or
	<varargs.h>.  If using <stdarg.h>, use the two-argument form of
	va_start(), otherwise the single-argument form.

	* fvwm/menus.c (menuShortcuts): Fixed parameters in call to
	XLookupString().

	* fvwm/fvwm2.1: Replace references to Fvwm.tmpl with current
	equivalents.  Other fixes from Austin Donelly.

	* fvwm/functions.c (func_comp): Put const qualifiers on the
	arguments, to match requirements for bsearch().

	* fvwm/builtins.c: Moved strerror() function to libs/strerror.c.

	* libs/sleep.c: Removed and globally changed sleep_a_little() to
	usleep().

	* libs/gethostname.c:
	* libs/strerror.c:
	* libs/usleep.c:
	* libs/strcasecmp.c:
	* libs/strncasecmp.c:

	* libs/Makefile.am: Added the above files.  Each file is compiled
	into libfvwm only if the system libraries are missing the
	corresponding function.  Globally replaced the "my"-version of
	these functions with the standard one.

	* include config.h: Moved #include to the top of the file in some
	but not yet all the files that include config.h.

	* main: All main() functions return int rather than void.

	* symbols: Changed the ifdefs around header includes to read
	#if HAVE_FOO_H, rather than a maze of machine-type symbols.

	* sun_headers.h:
	* sunos_headers.h:
	* alpha_header.h: Removed all traces of these.  Removed
	declarations of system functions when a conflict noticed.

	* configure.in: Require autoconf 2.12 as prerequisite.  Changed
	version string to 2.1.1.  Added more checks.

	* acconfig.h: Code to define str[r]chr and mem{cpy,move} if not
	available.  Removed obsolete FVWM_INLINE and globally replaced
	with "inline".

	* Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Set to 1.3b, so that automake
	complains if it is too old.

	* utils/xpm-reduce.c
	* utils/xpm-reduced-rgb.txt: removed; obsoleted by a runtime
	colour reduction scheme.

1998-11-04  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* Fix problems discovered by Purify:

	* fvwm/menus.c (MenuInteraction): Don't try to call
	GetPopupOptions() until we know we're looking at a popup menu.

	* fvwm/misc.c (GetOneMenuPositionArgument): If the returned token
	is an empty string, don't try to parse it.

	Fixed broken left menus with mwm/noanimation style when near the
	right edge of screen.

	* TODO: Renamed TO-DO to standard name TODO

	* NEWS: Added web docs.html to end of NEWS file.

Wed Nov  4 11:09:11 1998  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* sample.fvwmrc/system.fvwm2rc*: Removed the lines setting
	ModulePath, IconPath, and PixmapPath, since the compiled-in
	defaults can be set using configure.
