ASCIIDOC TODO LIST
==================

(In a rough order):

Immediate Priority
==================

* Not all commands listed here reflect what's currently in "man fvwm" -
* notably:
    - Nothing about invocation.
    - Nothing about FVWM variables $[foo]
    - etc.
* Produce a TOC for top-level includes (c.f. perldoc?)
* Each "top-level" .txt file needs a serious overview section for the files
  it's including.  This might mean further splitting out of sections.
  That's OK as long as this is documented.
* Look at a stylesheet for formats other than Groff.
* There needs to be better formatting/linking within the AsciiDoc structure
  between files.  Confer, adding single-quotes around CamelCased words in
  many documents -- this case often signifies FVWM commands, for example.
  See also the "link:" macro in AsciiDoc.
* FVWM Modules all need converting over to AsciiDoc.
* FvwmStyle/* needs a huge overhaul -- the Style.txt section is *HUGE*.
* FvwmModules/Modules.txt has a list of modules shipped with FVWM.  This
  information is better off in the top-level fvwmmodules.txt file with
  appropriate formatting.

Would be nice:
==============

* Hook this in to the build system.
* Rip out the old Docbook stuff
* Work out how this affects fvwm-web

Sundry:
=======

* Shed-paint with others (whom?) whether the group commands are sufficient.
