ASCIIDOC TODO LIST
==================

(In no particular order):

* Convert remaining documents over -- only the directories with toplevel
  .txt files have been converted.
* Produce a TOC for top-level includes (c.f. perldoc?)
* Look at a stylesheet for formats other than Groff
* FVWM Modules all need converting over to AsciiDoc.
* Hook this in to the build system.
* Rip out the old Docbook stuff
* Work out how this affects fvwm-web
* FvwmModules/Modules.txt has a list of module shipped with FVWM.  This
  information is better off in the top-level fvwmmodules.txt file with
  appropriate formatting.
* Shed-paint with others (whom?) whether the group commands are sufficient.
