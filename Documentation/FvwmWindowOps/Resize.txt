'Resize' [frame] [direction dir [warptoborder]]::
'Resize' [fixeddirection] [w]width[ p | c ] [w]height[ p | c ]::
+
Allows for resizing a window. If called from somewhere in a window or its
border, then that window is resized. If called from the root window then
the user is allowed to select the target window.
+
The operation can be aborted with Escape or by pressing any mouse button
(except button 1 which confirms it).
+
If the optional arguments width and height are provided, then the window
is resized so that its dimensions are width by height. The units of width
and height are percent-of-screen, unless a letter 'p' is appended to one
or both coordinates, in which case the location is specified in pixels.
With a 'c' suffix the unit defined by the client application (hence the c)
is used. So you can say
+
----
Resize 80c 24c
----
+
to make a terminal window just big enough for 80x24 characters.
+
If the width or height is prefixed with the letter 'w' the size is not
taken as an absolute value but added to the current size of the window.
+
Example:
+
----
# Enlarge window by one line
Resize keep w+1c
----
+
Both, width and height can be negative. In this case the new size is the
screen size minus the given value. If either value is "keep", the
corresponding dimension of the window is left untouched. The new size is
the size of the client window, thus
+
----
Resize 100 100
----
+
may make the window bigger than the screen. To base the new size on the
size of the whole fvwm window, add the frame option after the command. The
options fixeddirection, direction and warptoborder are only used in
interactive move operations. With fixeddirection the same border is moved
even if the pointer moves past the opposite border. The direction option
must be followed by a direction name such as "NorthWest", "South" or
"East" (you get the idea). Resizing is started immediately, even if the
pointer is not on a border. The warptoborder option changes the behaviour
of the direction option so that the pointer is automatically warped to the
border in the given direction before starting to resize. Also, if resizing
is started by clicking on the window border, the pointer is warped to the
outer edge of the border.

Resize [ bottomright | br x y ]::
+
An alternate syntax is used if the keyword bottomright or in short br
follows the command name. In this case, the arguments x and y specify the
desired position of the bottom right corner of the window. They are
interpreted exactly like the x and y arguments of the Move command.
Actually, any of the options accepted by the Move command can be used.
