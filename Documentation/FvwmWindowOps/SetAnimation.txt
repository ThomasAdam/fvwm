SetAnimation

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   SetAnimation milliseconds-delay [fractions-to-move-list]

   Sets the time between frames and the list of fractional offsets to
   customize the animated moves of the AnimatedMove command and the animation
   of menus (if the menu style is set to animated; see MenuStyle command). If
   the fractions-to-move-list is omitted, only the time between frames is
   altered. The fractions-to-move-list specifies how far the window should be
   offset at each successive frame as a fraction of the difference between
   the starting location and the ending location. e.g.:

 SetAnimation 10 -.01 0 .01 .03 .08 .18 .3 \
   .45 .6 .75 .85 .90 .94 .97 .99 1.0

   Sets the delay between frames to 10 milliseconds, and sets the positions
   of the 16 frames of the animation motion. Negative values are allowed, and
   in particular can be used to make the motion appear more cartoonish, by
   briefly moving slightly in the opposite direction of the main motion. The
   above settings are the default.
