'ResizeMaximize' [resize-arguments]::
+
Combines the effects of Resize and Maximize in a single command. When used
on a maximized window, the window is resized and is still in the maximized
state afterwards. When used on an unmaximized window, the window is
resized and put into the maximized state afterwards. This is useful if the
user wants to resize the window temporarily and then return to the
original geometry. The resize-arguments are the same as for the Resize
command.
