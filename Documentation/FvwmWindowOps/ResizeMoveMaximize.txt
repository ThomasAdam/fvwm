'ResizeMoveMaximize' resize-arguments move-arguments::
+
Combines the effects of ResizeMove and Maximize in a single command. When
used on a maximized window, the window is resized and moved and is still
in the maximized state afterwards. When used on an unmaximized window, the
window is resized and put into the maximized state afterwards. This is
useful if the user wants to resize the window temporarily and then return
to the original geometry. The resize-arguments and move-arguments are the
same as for the ResizeMove command.
