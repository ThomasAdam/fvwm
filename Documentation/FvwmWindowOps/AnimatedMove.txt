'AnimatedMove' x y [Warp]::
+
Move a window in an animated fashion. Similar to Move command. The options
are the same, except they are required, since it doesn't make sense to
have a user move the window interactively and animatedly. If the optional
argument Warp is specified the pointer is warped with the window.
