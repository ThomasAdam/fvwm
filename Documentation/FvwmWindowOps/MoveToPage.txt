'MoveToPage' [options] [ x[ p | w ] y[ p | w ] ] | [prev]::
+
Moves the selected window to another page (x,y). The upper left page is
(0,0), the upper right is (M,0), where M is one less than the current
number of horizontal pages specified in the DesktopSize command. Similarly
the lower left page is (0,N), and the lower right page is (M,N). Negative
page numbers refer to pages from the rightmost/lowest page. If x and y are
not given, the window is moved to the current page (a window that has the
focus but is off-screen can be retrieved with this). Moving windows to a
page relative to the current page can be achieved by adding a trailing 'p'
after any or both numerical arguments. To move the window relative to its
current location, add a trailing 'w'. To move a window to the previous
page use prev as the single argument.
+
Windows are usually not moved beyond desk boundaries.
+
Possible options are wrapx and wrapy to wrap around the x or y coordinate
when the window is moved beyond the border of the desktop. For example,
with wrapx, when the window moves past the right edge of the desktop, it
reappears on the left edge. The options nodesklimitx and nodesklimity
allow moving windows beyond the desk boundaries in x and y direction
(disabling the wrapx and wrapy options).
