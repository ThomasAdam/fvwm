'PlaceAgain' [Anim] [Icon]::
+
Causes the current window's position to be re-computed using the initial
window placement logic. The window is moved to where it would have been if
it were a new window that had just appeared. Most useful with Smart or
Clever (ReallySmart) placement. With the optional argument Anim an
animated move is used to place the window in its new position. With the
additional option Icon, the icon is placed again instead.
