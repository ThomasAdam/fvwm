'XorPixmap' [pixmap]::
+
Selects the pixmap with which bits are xor'ed when doing rubber-band
window moving or resizing. This has a better chance of making the
rubber-band visible if XorValue does not give good results. An example
pixmap resize.rainbow.xpm is provided with the icon distribution. To turn
the XorPixmap off again use the XorValue command or omit the pixmap
argument.
