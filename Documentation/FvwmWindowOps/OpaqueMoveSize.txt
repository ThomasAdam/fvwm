OpaqueMoveSize

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   OpaqueMoveSize [percentage]

   Tells fvwm the maximum size window with which opaque window movement
   should be used. The percentage is percent of the total screen area (may be
   greater than 100). With

 OpaqueMoveSize 0

   all windows are moved using the traditional rubber-band outline. With

 OpaqueMoveSize unlimited

   or if a negative percentage is given all windows are moved as solid
   windows. The default is

 OpaqueMoveSize 5

   which allows small windows to be moved in an opaque manner but large
   windows are moved as rubber-bands. If percentage is omitted or invalid the
   default value is set. To resize windows in an opaque manner you can use
   the ResizeOpaque style. See the Style command.
