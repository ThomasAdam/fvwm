Move

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Move [[screen screen] [ w | m ]x[ p | w ]... [ w | m ]y[ p | w ]...
   [Warp]] | [pointer]

   Allows the user to move a window. If called from somewhere in a window or
   its border, then that window is moved. If called from the root window then
   the user is allowed to select the target window.

   If the literal option screen followed by a screen argument is specified,
   the coordinates are interpreted as relative to the given screen. The width
   and height of the screen are used for the calculations instead of the
   display dimensions. The screen as interpreted as in the MoveToScreen
   command. If the optional argument Warp is specified the pointer is warped
   with the window. If the single argument pointer is given, the top left
   corner of the window is moved to the pointer position before starting the
   operation; this is mainly intended for internal use by modules like
   FvwmPager.

   The operation can be aborted with Escape or any mouse button not set to
   place the window. By default mouse button 2 is set to cancel the move
   operation. To change this you may use the Mouse command with special
   context 'P' for Placement.

   The window condition PlacedByButton can be used to check if a specific
   button was pressed to place the window (see Current command).

   If the optional arguments x and y are provided, then the window is moved
   immediately without user interaction. Each argument can specify an
   absolute or relative position from either the left/top or right/bottom of
   the screen. By default, the numeric value given is interpreted as a
   percentage of the screen width/height, but a trailing 'p' changes the
   interpretation to mean pixels, while a trailing 'w' means precent of the
   window width/height. To move the window relative to its current position,
   add the 'w' (for "window") prefix before the x and/or y value. To move the
   window to a position relative to the current location of the pointer, add
   the 'm' (for "mouse") prefix. To leave either coordinate unchanged, "keep"
   can be specified in place of x or y.

   For advanced uses, the arguments x and y can be used multiple times, but
   without the prefix 'm' or 'w'. (See complex examples below).

   Simple Examples:

 # Interactive move
 Mouse 1 T A Move
 # Move window to top left is at (10%,10%)
 Mouse 2 T A Move 10 10
 # Move top left to (10pixels,10pixels)
 Mouse 3 T A Move 10p 10p

   More complex examples (these can be bound as actions to keystrokes, etc.;
   only the command is shown, though):

 # Move window so bottom right is at bottom
 # right of screen
 Move -0 -0

 # Move window so top left corner is 10 pixels
 # off the top left screen edge
 Move +-10 +-10

 # Move window 5% to the right, and to the
 # middle vertically
 Move w+5 50

 # Move window up 10 pixels, and so left edge
 # is at x=40 pixels
 Move 40p w-10p

 # Move window to the mouse pointer location
 Move m+0 m+0

 # Move window to center of screen (50% of screen
 # poition minus 50% of widow size).
 Move 50-50w 50-50w

   Note: In order to obtain moving windows which do not snap to screen, with
   interactive move, hold down Alt whilst moving the window to disable snap
   attraction if it's defined.
