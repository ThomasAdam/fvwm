'ResizeMove' resize-arguments move-arguments::
+
This command does the same as the Resize and Move commands, but in a
single call which is less visually disturbing. The resize-arguments are
exactly the same arguments as for the Resize command and the
move-arguments are exactly the same arguments as for the Move command
except the pointer option which is not supported by the ResizeMove
command.

Examples:

----
# Move window to top left corner and cover
# most of the screen

# Grow the focused window towards the top of screen

*Note*: Fvwm may not be able to parse the command properly if the option
bottomright of the Resize command is used.
