NAME

fvwmmodules - the Fvwm modules meta-man page.


SYNOPSIS
--------

Module [FvwmModule] [ModuleAlias]


DESCRIPTION
-----------

A Fvwm module is a separate program which runs as a separate Unix process but 
transmits commands to fvwm to execute. Users can write their own modules to do 
any weird or bizarre manipulations without bloating or affecting the integrity 
of fvwm itself.

Modules must be spawned by fvwm so that it can set up two pipes for fvwm and 
the module to communicate with. The pipes are already open for the module when 
it starts and the file descriptors for the pipes are provided as command line 
arguments.

Modules can be spawned by fvwm at any time during the X session by use of the 
Module command. Modules can exist for the duration of the X session, or can 
perform a single task and exit. If the module is still active when fvwm is told 
to quit, then fvwm closes the communication pipes and waits to receive a 
+SIGCHLD+ from the module, indicating that it has detected the pipe closure and 
has exited. If modules fail to detect the pipe closure fvwm exits after 
approximately 30 seconds anyway. The number of simultaneously executing modules 
is limited by the operating system's maximum number of simultaneously open 
files, usually between 60 and 256.

Modules simply transmit commands to the fvwm command engine. Commands are 
formatted just as in the case of a mouse binding in the config setup file. 
Certain auxiliary information is also transmitted.

Please refer to the *Module Commands* section in *fvwm*(1) for common details.
