'WarpToWindow' x[p] y[p]::
+
Warps the cursor to the associated window. The parameters x and y default
to percentage of window down and in from the upper left hand corner (or
number of pixels down and in if 'p' is appended to the numbers). If a
number is negative the opposite edge is used and the direction reversed.
This command works also with windows that are not managed by fvwm. In this
case fvwm does not bring the window onto the screen if it is not visible.
For example it is possible to warp the pointer to the center of the root
window on screen 1:
