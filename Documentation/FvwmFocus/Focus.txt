'Focus' [NoWarp]::
+
Sets the keyboard focus to the selected window. If the NoWarp argument is
given, this is all it does. Otherwise it also moves the viewport or window
as needed to make the selected window visible. This command does not
automatically raise the window. Does not warp the pointer into the
selected window (see WarpToWindow function). Does not de-iconify. This
command does not alter the order of the WindowList, it rotates the
WindowList around so that the target window is at the start.
+
When the NoWarp argument is given, Focus cannot transfer the keyboard
focus to windows on other desks.
+
To raise and/or warp a pointer to a window together with Focus or
FlipFocus, use a function, like:
+
------
AddToFunc SelectWindow
+ I Focus
+ I Iconify false
+ I Raise
+ I WarpToWindow 50 8p
------
