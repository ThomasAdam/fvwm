'FlipFocus' [NoWarp]::

Executes a Focus command as if the user had used the pointer to select the
window. This command alters the order of the WindowList in the same way as
clicking in a window to focus, i.e. the target window is removed from the
WindowList and placed at the start. This command is recommended for use
with the Direction command and in the function invoked from WindowList.
