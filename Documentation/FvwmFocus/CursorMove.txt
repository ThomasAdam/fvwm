CursorMove

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   CursorMove horizontal[p] vertical[p]

   Moves the mouse pointer by horizontal pages in the X direction and
   vertical pages in the Y direction. Either or both entries may be negative.
   Both horizontal and vertical values are expressed in percent of pages, so

 CursorMove 100 100

   means to move down and right by one full page.

 CursorMove 50 25

   means to move right half a page and down a quarter of a page.
   Alternatively, the distance can be specified in pixels by appending a 'p'
   to the horizontal and/or vertical specification. For example

 CursorMove -10p -10p

   means move ten pixels up and ten pixels left. The CursorMove function
   should not be called from pop-up menus.
