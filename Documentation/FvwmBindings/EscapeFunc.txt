'EscapeFunc'::
+
By default the key sequence Ctrl-Alt-Escape allows for escaping from a
Wait pause and from a locked ModuleSynchronous command. The EscapeFunc
command used with the Key command allows for configuring this key
sequence. An example:
+
-----
Key Escape A MC -
Key Escape A  S EscapeFunc
-----
+
replaces the Ctrl-Alt-Escape key sequence with Shift-Escape for aborting a
Wait pause and ModuleSynchronous command. EscapeFunc used outside the Key
command does nothing.
