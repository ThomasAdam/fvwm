'Stroke' [(window)] Sequence Button Context Modifiers Function::

Binds a mouse stroke sequence to a specified fvwm command, or removes the
binding if Function is '-'. The syntax is the same as for a Mouse binding
except that Sequence is inserted in front of the button number and a value
of 0 for Button concerns the StrokeFunc command. The Context and Modifiers
fields are defined as in the Mouse binding. However, only the 'R' Context
really works (if you want to use other contexts you need to use the
StrokeFunc below).

Strokes sequences are defined in a telephone grid like this:

-----
  1  2  3

  4  5  6

  7  8  9
-----

or in a numeric pad grid like this:

-----
  7  8  9

  4  5  6

  1  2  3
-----

The telephone grid is used by default, to use the numeric pad grid you
should begin the sequence with a 'N'. Note that a complex motion may
produce several different sequences (see the "netscape" example below to
handle such motion). Moreover, sequences are limited to 20 elements (with
the present version of libstroke), however, in practice it is preferable
to use sequence with less than 12 elements.

Because of the default button menu in fvwm, you may need to remove a mouse
button binding (using an empty action) before using the stroke

-----
Mouse 3 R N
-----

Also, you can still use the stroke "sequence 0" to simulate a click:

-----
Stroke 0 3 R N Menu WindowList Nop
-----

The following example starts xterm when the mouse drags an 'I' on the root
window with button 3 pressed down:

-----
Stroke 258  3  R  N  Exec exec xterm
-----

An example for Netscape:

------
Stroke 7415963    3  R  N  Exec exec netscape
Stroke 74148963   3  R  N  Exec exec netscape
Stroke 74158963   3  R  N  Exec exec netscape
Stroke 7418963    3  R  N  Exec exec netscape
Stroke 415963     3  R  N  Exec exec netscape
-----

You may prefer to use the numeric pad grid since you have such a grid on
your machine. Here an example:

-----
Stroke N78963214   3  R  N FvwmForm FvwmForm-QuitVerify
Stroke N789632147  3  R  N FvwmForm FvwmForm-QuitVerify
-----

This example starts the "QuitVerify" form if you draw a box that begins in
the top left corner.

Note: You need libstroke installed and fvwm compiled with stroke support.
