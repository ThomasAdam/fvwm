'PointerKey' [(window)] Keyname Context Modifiers Function::
+
This command works exactly like the Key command. The only difference is
that the binding operates on the window under the pointer. Normal key
bindings operate on the focused window instead. The PointerKey command can
for example be used to bind keys to the root window if you are using
SloppyFocus or ClickToFocus. However, some applications (xterm is one
example) are unable to handle this key anymore, even if the pointer is
over the xterm window. It is recommended to use the PointerKey command
only for key combinations that are not needed in any application window.
