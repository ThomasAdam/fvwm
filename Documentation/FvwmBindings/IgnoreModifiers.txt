'IgnoreModifiers' [Modifiers]::

Tells fvwm which modifiers to ignore when matching Mouse or Key bindings.
IgnoreModifiers affects the ClickToFocus style too. This command belongs
into your config. If you issue it when your fvwm session is already up and
running the results are unpredictable. The should appear before any
applications or modules are started in your config file (e.g. with the
Exec command).

Modifiers has the same syntax as in the Mouse or Key bindings, with the
addition of 'L' meaning the caps lock key. The default is "L". Modifiers
can be omitted, meaning no modifiers are ignored. This command comes in
handy if the num-lock and scroll-lock keys interfere with your shortcuts.
With XFree86 '2' usually is the num-lock modifier and '5' refers to the
scroll-lock key. To turn all these pesky modifiers off you can use this
command:

-----
IgnoreModifiers L25
-----

If the Modifiers argument is the string "default", fvwm reverts back to
the default value "L".

Important

This command creates a lot of extra network traffic, depending on your
CPU, network connection, the number of Key or Mouse commands in your
configuration file and the number of modifiers you want to ignore. If you
do not have a lightning fast machine or very few bindings you should not
ignore more than two modifiers. I.e. do not ignore scroll-lock if you have
no problem with it. In the FAQ you can find a better solution of this
problem.
