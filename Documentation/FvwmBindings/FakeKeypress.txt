'FakeKeypress' [ command value ]...::

This command is mainly intended for debugging fvwm and no guarantees are
made that it works for you. FakeKeypress can simulate key press and
release events and pass them to fvwm or applications. The parameters are a
list of commands which consist of pairs of command tokens and values. The
press and release commands are followed by a key name. The key name is a
standard X11 key name as defined in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h, (without
the XK_ prefix), or the keysym database /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB. The
wait, modifiers and depth commands are the same as those used by
FakeClick.
