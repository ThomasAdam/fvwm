'FakeClick' [ command value ]...::
+
This command is mainly intended for debugging fvwm and no guarantees are
made that it works for you. FakeClick can simulate mouse button press and
release events and pass them to fvwm or the applications. The parameters
are a list of commands which consist of pairs of command tokens and
integer values, The press and release commands are followed by the
appropriate mouse button number and generate a button press or release
event on the window below the pointer. The wait commands pauses fvwm for
the given number of milliseconds. The modifiers command simulates pressing
or releasing modifier keys. The values 1 to 5 are mapped to Mod1 to Mod5
while 6, 7 and 8 are mapped to Shift, Lock and Control. The modifier is
set for any further button events. To release a modifier key, use the
corresponding negative number. The depth command determines to which
window the button events are sent. With a depth of 1, all events go to the
root window, regardless of the pointer's position. With 2, the event is
passed to the top level window under the pointer which is usually the
frame window. With 3, events go to the client window. Higher numbers go to
successive sub windows. Zero (0) goes to the smallest window that contains
the pointer. Note that events propagate upward.

This simulates a click with button 1 in the parent window (depth 2) with a
delay of 250 milliseconds between the press and the release. Note: all
command names can be abbreviated with their first letter.
