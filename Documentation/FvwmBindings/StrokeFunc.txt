'StrokeFunc' [Options]::
+
Causes fvwm to record a mouse stroke sequence and to execute the
corresponding action as defined in a Stroke command. The cursor is
modified to the STROKE context of the CursorStyle command during
recording. When the stroke is finished StrokeFunc looks for a stroke
binding of the form
+
-----
Stroke sequence 0 Context Modifiers action
-----
+
and executes the corresponding action (Note the 0). Normal use of this
function is via a Mouse or Key command. Examples:
+
-----
Mouse 3 A M StrokeFunc
Key x R N StrokeFunc
-----
+
If you press mouse button 3 and Alt anywhere (respectively, press the key
x when the cursor is on the root window), then fvwm records the mouse
motions until the mouse button 3 (respectively, the x key) is released and
then check if the recorded sequence corresponds to a stroke binding of the
form
+
-----
"Stroke sequence 0 A M action"
"Stroke sequence 0 R N action"
-----
+
Note that the Context and Modifiers are taken at the beginning of the
execution of the StrokeFunc command (so you can release the modifiers
before the end of the stroke recording in the case of a mouse binding and
if you used, say, a title-bar context the mouse motion can go through an
application window). The keys Escape and Delete allow you to abort the
command.
+
The StrokeFunc command has five options: NotStayPressed, EchoSequence,
DrawMotion, FeedBack and StrokeWidth. These options are disabled by
default. EchoSequence causes fvwm to Echo the recorded stroke sequence.
DrawMotion causes fvwm to draw the mouse motion on the screen. FeedBack
causes fvwm to display during a fraction of second the cursor of the WAIT
context of the CursorStyle command if the recorded stroke sequence
corresponds to a stroke binding. StrokeWidth takes an integer argument,
which must be >= 0 and <= 100 and which defines the width of the line for
the DrawMotion option.
+
NotStayPressed works only if StrokeFunc is used via a Mouse or a Key
command. This option removes the need to have a button or the key pressed
during the stroke, but you have to do a mouse click or press the Return or
Space key to finish the mouse motion recording (these keys also work
without the NotStayPressed option).
+
You can use the StrokeFunc "alone". In this case it works as above with
the NotStayPressed option enabled. However, Modifiers, in general, may not
work as expected (i.e., in this case use 'A' or 'N' as Modifiers in the
stroke bindings).
+
Note that some computers do not support key release events. If that is the
case the StrokeFunc used via a Key command works as if the NotStayPressed
option is enabled.
