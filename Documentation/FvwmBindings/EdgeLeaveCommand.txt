'EdgeLeaveCommand' [ direction [Function]]::

Binds a specified fvwm command Function to an edge of the screen.
Direction may be one of "North", "Top", "West", "Left", "South", "Bottom",
"Right" and "East". If Function is omitted the binding for this edge is
removed. If EdgeLeaveCommand is called without any arguments all edge
bindings are removed.

Function is executed when the mouse pointer leaves the invisible pan
frames that surround the visible screen. The binding works only if
EdgeThickness is set to a value greater than 0. If a function is bound to
an edge, scrolling specified by EdgeScroll is disabled for this edge. It
is possible to bind a function only to some edges and use the other edges
for scrolling. This command is intended to raise or lower certain windows
when the mouse pointer leaves an edge. FvwmAuto can be used get a delay
when raising or lowering windows. See example for EdgeCommand

Normally, the invisible pan frames are only on the screen edges that
border virtual pages. If a screen edge has a command bound to it, the pan
frame is always created on that edge.
