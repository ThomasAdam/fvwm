FVWM Documentation
==================

The FVWM man page is broken into several sections:

[ XXX: Describe those sections. ]

Adding a new man page section to an existing top-level include
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Decide which section it belongs in.  If that section already exists,
simply add the new file containing the appropriate information in to the
directory.

To help in this, see the following file:

------
    Documentation/sample/section.txt
------

This outlines the minimum amount of formatting required for when the new
file is added to an existing top-level man page section.  All other AsciiDoc
formatting rules apply.

So for example, let's say we're adding a new "FooBar" command which is a new
binding command.  We would add such a file to:

------
    Documentation/FvwmBindings/FooBar.txt
------

Then, we would add a corresponding include:: line to:

-----
    Documentation/fvwmbindings.txt
-----

Such as:

----
    include::FvwmBindings/FooBar.txt[]
----

Try and keep the inclusion in alphabetical order if possible, as this makes
searching easier.

Creating a new man page section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At a minimum, the AsciiDoc man page driver expects:

----
NAME
DESCRIPTION
SYNOPSIS
----

See the following template as an example:

-----
    Documentation/sample/toplevel-manpage.txt
-----

[ XXX: Also explain about "man fvwmall" or somesuch...

*NB* - AsciiDoc really doesn't like title markers under words to *EXCEED*
the length of the title!
