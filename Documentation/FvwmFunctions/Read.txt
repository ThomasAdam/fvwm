'Read' filename [quiet]::
+
Causes fvwm to read commands from the file named filename. If the keyword
Quiet follows the command no message is produced if the file is not found.
If the file name does not begin with a slash ('/'), fvwm looks in the
user's data directory, then the system data directory. The user's data
directory is by default $HOME/.fvwm. It can be overridden by exporting
FVWM_USERDIR set to any other directory. The Read command returns 1 if the
given file could be read or -1 if not (see the section 'Conditional
Commands' for the meaning of return codes).
