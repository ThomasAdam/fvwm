'SetEnv' variable value::
+
Set an environment variable to a new value, similar to the shell's export
or setenv command. The variable and its value are inherited by processes
started directly by fvwm. This can be especially useful in conjunction
with the FvwmM4 module. For example:
+
-----
SetEnv height HEIGHT
-----
+
makes the FvwmM4 set variable HEIGHT usable by processes started by fvwm
as the environment variable $height. If value includes whitespace, you
should enclose it in quotes. If no value is given, the variable is
deleted.
