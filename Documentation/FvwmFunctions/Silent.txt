Silent

   Silent command

   A number of commands require a window to operate on. If no window was
   selected when such a function is invoked the user is asked to select a
   window. Sometimes this behavior is unwanted, for example if the function
   was called by a module and the window that was selected at first does not
   exist anymore. You can prevent this by putting Silent in front of the fvwm
   command. If a function that needs a window is called with Silent without a
   window selected, it simply returns without doing anything. If Silent is
   used on a user defined function it affects all function and sub function
   calls until the original function exits.

   Another usage of Silent is with binding commands Key, PointerKey and
   Mouse, this disables error messages.

   Silent also disables the error message for non-existent commands. Note:
   This command is treated as a prefix to its command. Expansion of the
   command line is done as if Silent was not there.

   Examples:

 Silent Move 0 0
 Silent User_defined_function
 # do not complain on keyboards without "Help" key
 Silent Key Help R A Popup HelpMenu
