PipeRead

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   PipeRead command [quiet]

   Causes fvwm to read commands from the output of the command. This command
   is executed by /bin/sh as if you typed it on the command line. If the
   command consists of more than one word it must be quoted. Useful for
   building up dynamic menu entries based on a directories contents, for
   example. If the keyword Quiet follows the command no message is produced
   if the command is not found.

   Example:

 AddToMenu HomeDirMenu
 PipeRead 'for i in $HOME/*; \
   do echo "+ $i Exec xterm -e vi $i"; done'

   Note: The PipeRead changes the pointer to a watch cursor by default during
   execution. However, some commands, for example xwd, need to take control
   of the pointer themselves and do not work. To disable the watch cursor,
   use the command prior to PipeRead

 BusyCursor Read off

   The PipeRead command executes synchronously. If you want to Exec
   something, but need the command to run synchronously, you might do
   something like:

 PipeRead 'command 1>&2'

   The redirection causes any output from the program to go to stderr instead
   of being read as a sequence of commands by fvwm. PipeRead returns 1 if the
   given command could be executed or -1 if not (see the section Conditional
   Commands for the meaning of return codes).
