'Exec' command::
+
Executes command. You should not use an ampersand '&' at the end of the
command. You probably want to use an additional "exec" at the beginning of
command. Without that, the shell that fvwm invokes to run your command
stays until the command exits. In effect, you'll have twice as many
processes running as you need. Note that some shells are smart enough to
avoid this, but it never hurts to include the "exec" anyway.
+
The following example binds function key F1 in the root window, with no
modifiers, to the exec function. The program rxvt is started with an
assortment of options.
+
--------
Key F1 R N Exec exec rxvt -fg yellow -bg blue \
    -e /bin/tcsh
--------
+
Note that this function doesn't wait for command to complete, so things
like:
+
-------
Exec "echo AddToMenu ... > /tmp/file"
Read /tmp/file
--------
+
do not work reliably (see the PipeRead command).
