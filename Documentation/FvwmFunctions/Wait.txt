'Wait' window::
+
This command is intended to be used in fvwm functions only. It causes
execution of a function to pause until a new window matching window
appears. This can be a window's name, class, or resource string. It may
contain the wildcards '*' and '?', which are matched in the usual Unix
filename manner. This is particularly useful in the "InitFunction" if you
are trying to start windows on specific desktops:
+
--------
AddToFunc InitFunction
+ I Exec exec xterm -geometry 80x64+0+0
+ I Wait xterm
+ I GotoDesk 0 2
+ I Exec exec xmh -font fixed -geometry \
    507x750+0+0
+ I Wait xmh
+ I GotoDesk 0 0
---------
+
The above function starts an xterm on the current desk, waits for it to
map itself, then switches to desk 2 and starts an xmh. After the xmh
window appears control moves to desk 0.
+
Fvwm remains partially functional during a wait, but any input from the
modules is queued up and processed only after the window appears or the
command is aborted. For example, windows can not be focused with
FvwmTaskBar or FvwmWinList during a wait.
+
You can escape from a Wait pause by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Escape (where Alt is
the first modifier). To redefine this key sequence see the EscapeFunc
command.
