Function

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Function FunctionName

   Used to bind a previously defined function to a key or mouse button. The
   following example binds mouse button 1 to a function called
   "Move-or-Raise", whose definition was provided as an example earlier in
   this man page. After performing this binding fvwm executes the
   "move-or-raise" function whenever button 1 is pressed in a window's
   title-bar.

 Mouse 1 T A Function Move-or-Raise

   The keyword Function may be omitted if FunctionName does not coincide with
   an fvwm command.

   Warning: Please read the comments on executing complex functions in the
   section Scripting and Complex Functions.
