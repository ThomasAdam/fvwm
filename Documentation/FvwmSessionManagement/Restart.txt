Restart

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Restart [window_manager [params] ]

   Causes fvwm to restart itself if window_manager is left blank, or to
   switch to an alternate window manager (or other fvwm version) if
   window_manager is specified. If the window manager is not in your default
   search path, then you should use the full path name for window_manager.

   This command should not have a trailing ampersand. The command can have
   optional parameters with simple shell-like syntax. You can use ~ (is
   expanded to the user's home directory) and environmental variables $VAR or
   ${VAR}. Here are several examples:

 Key F1 R N Restart
 Key F1 R N Restart fvwm -s
 Key F1 R N Restart ~/bin/fvwm -f $HOME/.fvwm/main
 Key F1 R N Restart fvwm1 -s -f .fvwmrc
 Key F1 R N Restart xterm -n '"X console"' \
   -T \"X\ console\" -e fvwm1 -s

   If you need a native restart, we suggest only to use Restart command
   without parameters unless there is a reason not to. If you still use an
   old command 'Restart fvwm2' that was correct in 2.2.x, all current command
   line arguments are lost. On a restart without parameters or with
   --pass-args, they are preserved. Here are some cases when 'Restart fvwm2'
   or 'Restart fvwm' cause troubles:

 * running fvwm under a session manager
 * running fvwm with multi headed displays
 * having command line arguments, like
   -f themes-rc or -cmd
 * if the first fvwm2 in the $PATH is a
   different one

   This is why we are issuing a warning on an old usage. If you really want
   to restart to fvwm with no additional arguments, you may get rid of this
   warning by using "Restart fvwm -s" or "Restart /full/path/fvwm".

   Note, currently with multi headed displays, restart of fvwms on different
   screens works independently.

   Restart --pass-args window_manager

   The same as Restart without parameters but the name for the current window
   manager is replaced with the specified window_manager and original
   arguments are preserved.

   This command is useful if you use initial arguments like

 -cmd FvwmCpp

   and want to switch to another fvwm version without losing the initial
   arguments.

   Restart --dont-preserve-state [other-params]

   The same as

 Restart [other-params]

   but it does not save any window states over the restart.

   Without this option, Restart preserves most per-window state by writing it
   to a file named .fs-restart-$HOSTDISPLAY in the user's home directory.
