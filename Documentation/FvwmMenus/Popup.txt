Popup

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Popup PopupName [position] [default-action]

   This command has two purposes: to bind a menu to a key or mouse button,
   and to bind a sub menu into a menu. The formats for the two purposes
   differ slightly. The position arguments are the same as for Menu. The
   command default-action is invoked if the user clicks a button to invoke
   the menu and releases it immediately again (or hits the key rapidly twice
   if the menu is bound to a key). If the default action is not specified,
   double clicking on the menu does nothing. However, if the menu begins with
   a menu item (i.e. not with a title or a separator) and the default action
   is not given, double clicking invokes the first item of the menu (but only
   if the pointer really was over the item).

   To bind a previously defined pop-up menu to a key or mouse button:

   The following example binds mouse buttons 2 and 3 to a pop-up called
   "Window Ops". The menu pops up if the buttons 2 or 3 are pressed in the
   window frame, side-bar, or title-bar, with no modifiers (none of shift,
   control, or meta).

 Mouse 2 FST N Popup "Window Ops"
 Mouse 3 FST N Popup "Window Ops"

   Pop-ups can be bound to keys through the use of the Key command. Pop-ups
   can be operated without using the mouse by binding to keys and operating
   via the up arrow, down arrow, and enter keys.

   To bind a previously defined pop-up menu to another menu, for use as a sub
   menu:

   The following example defines a sub menu "Quit-Verify" and binds it into a
   main menu, called "RootMenu":

 AddToMenu Quit-Verify
  + "Really Quit Fvwm?" Title
  + "Yes, Really Quit"  Quit
  + "Restart Fvwm"      Restart
  + "Restart Fvwm 1.xx" Restart fvwm1 -s
  + ""                  Nop
  + "No, Don't Quit"    Nop

 AddToMenu RootMenu "Root Menu" Title
  + "Open XTerm Window" Popup NewWindowMenu
  + "Login as Root"     Exec exec xterm -T Root -n Root -e su -
  + "Login as Anyone"   Popup AnyoneMenu
  + "Remote Hosts"      Popup HostMenu
  + ""                  Nop
  + "X utilities"       Popup Xutils
  + ""                  Nop
  + "Fvwm Modules"      Popup Module-Popup
  + "Fvwm Window Ops"   Popup Window-Ops
  + ""                  Nop
  + "Previous Focus"    Prev (AcceptsFocus) Focus
  + "Next Focus"        Next (AcceptsFocus) Focus
  + ""                  Nop
  + "Refresh screen"    Refresh
  + ""                  Nop
  + "Reset X defaults"  Exec xrdb -load \
                        $HOME/.Xdefaults
  + ""                  Nop
  + ""                  Nop
  + Quit                Popup Quit-Verify

   Popup differs from Menu in that pop-ups do not stay up if the user simply
   clicks. These are popup-menus, which are a little hard on the wrist. Menu
   menus stay up on a click action. See the Menu command for an explanation
   of the interactive behavior of menus. A menu can be open up to ten times
   at once, so a menu may even use itself or any of its predecessors as a sub
   menu.
