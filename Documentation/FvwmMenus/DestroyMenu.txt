'DestroyMenu' [recreate] menu::
+
Deletes a menu, so that subsequent references to it are no longer valid.
You can use this to change the contents of a menu during an fvwm session.
The menu can be rebuilt using AddToMenu. The optional parameter recreate
tells fvwm not to throw away the menu completely but to throw away all the
menu items (including the title).
