PrintInfo

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   PrintInfo subject [verbose]

   Print information on subject on stderr. An optional integer argument
   verbose defines the level of information which is given. The current valid
   subjects are:

   Colors which prints information about the colors used by fvwm. This useful
   on screens which can only display 256 (or less) colors at once. If verbose
   is one or greater the palette used by fvwm is printed. If you have a
   limited color palette, and you run out of colors, this command might be
   helpful.

   ImageCache which prints information about the images loaded by fvwm. If
   verbose is one or greater all images in the cache will be listed together
   with their respective reuse.

   Locale which prints information on your locale and the fonts that fvwm
   used. verbose can be 1 or 2.

   nls which prints information on the locale catalogs that fvwm used

   style which prints information on fvwm styles. verbose can be 1.

   bindings which prints information on all the bindings fvwm has: key, mouse
   and stroke bindings. verbose has no effect with this option.
