ImagePath

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   ImagePath path

   Specifies a colon separated list of directories in which to search for
   images (both monochrome and pixmap). To find an image given by a relative
   pathname, fvwm looks into each directory listed in turn, and uses the
   first file found.

   If a directory is given in the form "/some/dir;.ext", this means all
   images in this directory have the extension ".ext" that should be forced.
   The original image name (that may contain another extension or no
   extension at all) is not probed, instead ".ext" is added or replaces the
   original extension. This is useful, for example, if a user has some image
   directories with ".xpm" images and other image directories with the same
   names, but ".png" images.

   The path may contain environment variables such as $HOME (or ${HOME}).
   Further, a '+' in the path is expanded to the previous value of the path,
   allowing appending or prepending to the path easily.

   For example:

 ImagePath $HOME/icons:+:/usr/include/X11/bitmaps

   Note: if the FvwmM4 module is used to parse your config files, then m4 may
   want to mangle the word "include" which frequently shows up in the
   ImagePath command. To fix this one may add

 undefine(`include')

   prior to the ImagePath command, or better: use the -m4-prefix option to
   force all m4 directives to have a prefix of "m4_" (see the FvwmM4 man
   page).
