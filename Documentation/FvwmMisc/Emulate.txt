'Emulate' Fvwm | Mwm | Win::
+
This command is a catch all for how miscellaneous things are done by fvwm.
Right now this command affects where the move/resize feedback window
appears and how window placement is aborted. To have more Mwm- or Win-like
behavior you can call Emulate with Mwm or Win as its argument. With Mwm
resize and move feedback windows are in the center of the screen, instead
of the upper left corner. This also affects how manual placement is
aborted. See the ManualPlacement description.
