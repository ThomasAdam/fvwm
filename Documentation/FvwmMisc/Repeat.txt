'Repeat'::
+
When the Repeat command is invoked, the last command that was executed by
fvwm is executed again. This happens regardless of whether it was
triggered by user interaction, a module or by an X event. Commands that
are executed from a function defined with the Function command, from the
Read or PipeRead commands or by a menu are not repeated. Instead, the
function, menu or the Read or PipeRead command is executed again.
