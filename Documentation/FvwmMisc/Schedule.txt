   Schedule [Periodic] delay_ms [command_id] command

   The command is executed after about delay_ms milliseconds. This may be
   useful in some tricky setups. The command is executed in the same context
   window as the Schedule command. An optional integer argument command_id
   may be given in decimal, hexadecimal or octal format. This id can be used
   with the Deschedule command to remove the scheduled command before it is
   executed. If no id is given, fvwm uses negative id numbers, starting with
   -1 and decreasing by one with each use of the Schedule command. Note that
   the Schedule command and its arguments undergo the usual command line
   expansion, and, when command is finally executed, it is expanded again. It
   may therefore be necessary to quote the parts of the command that must not
   be expanded twice.

   Note: A window's id as it is returned with $[w.id] can be used as the
   command_id. Example:

 Current Schedule 1000 $[w.id] WindowShade

   The Schedule command also supports the optional keyword Periodic which
   indicates that the command should be executed every delay_ms. Example:

 Schedule Periodic 10000 PipeRead '[ -N "$MAIL" ] && echo \
      Echo You have mail'

   Use the Deschedule command to stop periodic commands.
