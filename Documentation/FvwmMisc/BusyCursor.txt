'BusyCursor' [Option bool],...::
+
This command controls the cursor during the execution of certain commands.
Option can be DynamicMenu, ModuleSynchronous, Read, Wait or *. An option
must be followed by a boolean argument bool. You can use commas to
separate individual options. If you set an option to "True", then when the
corresponding command is run, fvwm displays the cursor of the WAIT context
of the CursorStyle command. "False" forces to not display the cursor. The
default is:
+
----
BusyCursor DynamicMenu False, ModuleSynchronous False, \
Read False, Wait False
----
+
The '*' option refers to all available options.
+
The 'Read' option controls the 'PipeRead' command.
+
The DynamicMenu option affects the DynamicPopupAction and
MissingSubmenuFunction options of the AddToMenu command. If this option is
set to "False", then the busy cursor is not displayed during a dynamic
menu command even if this command is a Read or PipeRead command and the
Read option is set to "True".
+
The ModuleSynchronous option affects the ModuleSynchronous command. If
this option is set to "False", then the busy cursor is not displayed while
fvwm waits for a module started by ModuleSynchronous to complete its
startup.
+
The Wait option affects only the root cursor. During a wait pause the root
cursor is replaced by the busy cursor and fvwm is still fully functional
(you can escape from the pause, see the EscapeFunc command). If you want
to use this option and if you do not use the default root cursor, you must
set your root cursor with the CursorStyle command.
