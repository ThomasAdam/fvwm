'EdgeResistance' delay::
'EdgeResistance' scrolling moving [xinerama-scrolling]::
+
Tells how hard it should be to change the desktop viewport by moving the
mouse over the edge of the screen. The parameter tells how many
milliseconds the pointer must spend on the screen edge before fvwm moves
the viewport. This is intended for people who use:
+
----
EdgeScroll 100 100
----
+
But find themselves accidentally flipping pages when they do not want to.
If -1 is given as the delay, scrolling is disabled completely.
+
The second form of invocation with two or three arguments is obsolete and
should be replaced with the following three commands as needed:
+
----
EdgeResistance scrolling
Style * EdgeMoveDelay scrolling
Style * EdgeMoveResistance moving
----
+
or
+
----
Style * EdgeMoveResistance moving xinerama-scrolling
----
+
Fvwm does this substitution automatically and prints a warning.
