The primary screen is used in some of the modules and for the default icon
box too. Any number that is zero or more is taken as the primary screen's
number. Instead, the letter 'c' indicates to use the current screen
(containing the pointer) whenever the primary screen is used. This may be
very confusing under some circumstances. With 'g', the global screen is
used as the primary screen, effectively disabling the primary screen.
Calling this function with any other argument (including none) resets the
primary screen to 0.
