'GotoPage' prev | [options] x[p] y[p]::
+
Moves the desktop viewport to page (x,y). The upper left page is (0,0),
the upper right is (M,0), where M is one less than the current number of
horizontal pages specified in the DesktopSize command. The lower left page
is (0,N), and the lower right page is (M,N), where N is the desktop's
vertical size as specified in the DesktopSize command. To switch to a page
relative to the current one add a trailing 'p' after any or both numerical
arguments.
+
Possible options are wrapx and wrapy to wrap around the x or y coordinate
when the viewport is moved beyond the border of the desktop.
+
To go to the last visited page use prev as the first argument. The
GotoPage function should not be used in a pop-up menu.

Examples:

# Go to page (2,3)

# Go to lowest and rightmost page
GotoPage -1 -1

# Go to last page visited
