GotoDesk

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   GotoDesk [ prev | arg1 [arg2] [min max] ]

   Switches the current viewport to another desktop (workspace, room).

   The command takes 1, 2, 3, or 4 arguments. A single argument is
   interpreted as a relative desk number. Two arguments are understood as a
   relative and an absolute desk number. Three arguments specify a relative
   desk and the minimum and maximum of the allowable range. Four arguments
   specify the relative, absolute, minimum and maximum values. (Desktop
   numbers can be negative). If a literal prev is given as the single
   argument, the last visited desk number is used.

   If arg1 is non zero then the next desktop number is the current desktop
   number plus arg1.

   If arg1 is zero then the new desktop number is arg2. (If arg2 is not
   present, then the command has no effect.)

   If min and max are given, the new desktop number is no smaller than min
   and no bigger than max. Values out of this range are truncated (if you
   gave an absolute desk number) or wrapped around (if you gave a relative
   desk number).

   The syntax is the same as for MoveToDesk, which moves a window to a
   different desktop.

   The number of active desktops is determined dynamically. Only desktops
   which contain windows or are currently being displayed are active. Desktop
   numbers must be between 2147483647 and -2147483648 (is that enough?).
