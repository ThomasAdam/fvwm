'XineramaSlsScreens' number-of-screens [screen-spec...]::
+
This command configures the layout of the Single Logical screen feature.
Its first argument is the number of screens to use. It must be followed by
exactly this number of screen-spec arguments. Each of these can be written
either in standard X geometry format: "<width>x<height>+<x>+<y>" or as a
space separated list of numbers: "x y width height". Both ways of
describing screens can be mixed in a single command. All four numbers must
be supplied. The x and y values specify the origin of the screen in
relation to the global screen's origin while width and height specify the
size of the screen in pixels. No checks are done if the geometries make
sense, so it is possible to define overlapping screens (with random
results) or screens that are not visible at all.
