EdgeScroll

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   EdgeScroll horizontal[p] vertical[p] [ wrap | wrapx | wrapy ]

   Specifies the percentage of a page to scroll when the cursor hits the edge
   of a page. A trailing 'p' changes the interpretation to mean pixels. If
   you do not want any paging or scrolling when you hit the edge of a page
   include

 EdgeScroll 0 0

   in your config file, or possibly better, set the EdgeThickness to zero.
   See the EdgeThickness command. If you want whole pages, use

 EdgeScroll 100 100

   Both horizontal and vertical should be positive numbers.

   If the horizontal and vertical percentages are multiplied by 1000 or one
   of the keywords wrap, wrapx and wrapy is given then scrolling wraps around
   at the edge of the desktop. If

 EdgeScroll 100000 100000

   is used fvwm scrolls by whole pages, wrapping around at the edge of the
   desktop.
