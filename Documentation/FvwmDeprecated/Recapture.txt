This command is obsolete and should not be used anymore. Should you want
to do something specific that you cannot do without it, please report this
to the fvwm-workers mailing list <fvwm-workers@fvwm.org>. This command may
be removed at some point in the future. Please read the note at the end of
the section Delayed Execution of Commands to learn about how to avoid the
Recapture command.

Causes fvwm to recapture all of its windows. This ensures that the latest
style parameters are used. The recapture operation is visually disturbing.

Since fvwm version 2.4 only a very few Style options need a Recapture to
take effect (e.g. UseStyle).
