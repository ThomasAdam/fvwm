'Maximize' [flags] [bool] [horizontal[p]] [vertical[p]]::
+
Without its optional arguments (or if the bool bit has the value "toggle")
Maximize causes the window to alternately switch from a full-screen size
to its normal size. To force a window into maximized (normal) state you
can use a "True" or "False" value for the bool argument.
+
With the optional arguments horizontal and vertical, which are expressed
as percentage of a full screen, the user can control the new size of the
window. An optional suffix 'p' can be used to indicate pixels instead of
percents of the screen size. If horizontal is greater than 0 then the
horizontal dimension of the window is set to horizontal*screen_width/100.
If the value is smaller than 0 the size is subtracted from the screen
width, i.e. -25 is the same as 75. If horizontal is "grow", it is
maximized to curren available space until finding any obstacle. The
vertical resizing is similar. If both horizontal and vertical values are
"grow", it expands vertically first, then horizontally to find space.
Instead of the horizontal "grow" argument, "growleft" or "growright" can
be used respectively "growup" and "growdown". The optional flags argument
is a space separated list containing the following key words: ewmhiwa,
growonwindowlayer, growonlayers and screen. ewmhiwa causes fvwm to ignore
the EWMH working area. growonwindowlayer causes the various grow methods
to ignore windows with a layer other than the current layer of the window
which is maximized. The growonlayers option must have two integer
arguments. The first one is the minimum layer and the second one the
maximum layer to use. Windows that are outside of this range of layers are
ignored by the grow methods. A negative value as the first or second
argument means to assume no minimum or maximum layer. screen must have an
argument which specifies the Xinerama screen on which to operate. It can
be 'p' for the primary screen, 'c' for the current screen (containing the
mouse pointer), 'g' for the global screen or the screen number itself
(counting from zero). This option is only useful with multiple Xinerama
screens.

Here are some examples. The following adds a title-bar button to switch a
window to the full vertical size of the screen:
+
----
Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 0 100
----
+
The following causes windows to be stretched to the full width:
+
----
Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 100 0
----
+
This makes a window that is half the screen size in each direction:
+
----
Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 50 50
----
+
To expand a window horizontally until any other window is found:
+
----
Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 0 grow
----
+
To expand a window until any other window on the same or a higher layer is
hit.
+
----
Mouse 0 4 A Maximize growonlayers $[w.layer] -1 grow grow
-----
+
To expand a window but leave the lower 60 pixels of the screen unoccupied:
+
----
Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 100 -60p
----
+
Values larger than 100 can be used with caution.
