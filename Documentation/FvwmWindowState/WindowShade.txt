WindowShade

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   WindowShade [bool] | [[ShadeAgain] direction ]

   Toggles the window shade feature for titled windows. Windows in the shaded
   state only display a title-bar. If bool is not given or "toggle", the
   window shade state is toggled. If bool is "True", the window is forced to
   the shaded state. If bool is "False", then the window is forced to the
   non-shaded state. To force shading in a certain direction, the direction
   argument can be used. Any of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East",
   "NorthWest", "NorthEast", "SouthWest", "SouthEast" or "Last" can be given.
   The direction can be abbreviated with the usual one or two letters "N",
   "NW", etc. Using a direction on a window that was already shaded unshades
   the window. To shade it in a different direction, use the ShadeAgain
   option. The direction Last shades the window in the direction it last was
   shaded. If the window has never been shaded before it is shaded as if no
   direction had been given. Windows without titles can be shaded too. Please
   refer also to the options WindowShadeSteps, WindowShadeShrinks,
   WindowShadeScrolls, WindowShadeLazy, WindowShadeAlwaysLazy and
   WindowShadeBusy options of the Style command. Examples:

 Style * WindowShadeShrinks, WindowShadeSteps 20, \
         WindowShadeLazy
 Mouse 1 - S WindowShade North
 Mouse 1 [ S WindowShade West
 Mouse 1 ] S WindowShade E
 Mouse 1 _ S WindowShade S

   Note: When a window that has been shaded with a direction argument changes
   the direction of the window title (see TitleAtTop Style option), the
   shading direction does not change. This may look very strange. Windows
   that were shaded without a direction argument stay shaded in the direction
   of the title bar.

   For backward compatibility, the optional argument may also be 1 to signify
   "on", and 2 to signify "off". Note that this syntax is obsolete, and will
   be removed in the future.
