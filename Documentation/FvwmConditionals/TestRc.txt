'TestRc' [([!]returncode)] command::

Performs command if the last conditional command returned the value
returncode. Instead of the numeric values 0 (no match), 1 (match), -1
(error), and -2 (break) the symbolic names "NoMatch", "Match", "Error" and
"Break" can be used. If no returncode is given, the default 0 is assumed.
If the return code is prefixed with '!', the command is executed if
returncode does not match the value returned by the conditional command.
The TestRc command can only be used inside functions. If the command is
another conditional command, the previous return code is replaced by the
new one.

Example:

-----
AddToFunc ToggleXterm
+ I All (my_xtermwindow) Close
+ I TestRc (NoMatch) Exec xterm -T my_xtermwindow
