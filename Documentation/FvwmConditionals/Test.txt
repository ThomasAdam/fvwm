'Test' [(test-conditions)] command::

Performs command if all test-conditions are satisfied. The test-conditions
are keywords with possible arguments from the list below and are separated
by commas or whitespace. They include: Version operator x.y.z, EnvIsSet
varname, EnvMatch varname pattern, EdgeHasPointer direction, EdgeIsActive
direction, Start, Init, Restart, Exit, Quit, ToRestart, True, False, F, R,
W, X and I. A test-condition prefixed with "!" is negated.

The Version operator x.y.z test-condition is fulfilled if the logical
condition of the expression is true. Valid operator values are: >=, >, <=,
<, == and !=.

Example:

-----
Test (Version >= 2.5.11) Echo 2.5.11 or later.
-----

The EnvIsSet varname test-condition is true if the given environment
variable is set. The EnvMatch varname pattern test-condition is true if
pattern matches the given environment variable value. The pattern may
contain special "*" and "?" chars.

The EdgeHasPointer [direction] test-condition is true if the edge in the
given direction currently contains the pointer. The EdgeIsActive
[direction] test-condition is true if the edge in the given direction
currently is active. An edge is active, and can contain a pointer if
either a command is bound to it or edge scroll is available in that
direction. The direction may be one of Any, North, Top, Up, West, Left,
South, Bottom, Down, Right and East. If no direction is specified Any is
assumed.

The Start test-condition is the same as either Init or Restart. It is only
true on startup or restart prior and during StartFunction execution. The
Exit test-condition is the same as either Quit or ToRestart. It is only
valid on shutdown during ExitFunction function execution.

The True and False test-conditions are unconditionally true and false.

Additionally, if a test-condition name is not recognized, the Error return
code is set and the command is not executed.

The F file, R file, W file, X file and I file test-conditions test for
existence of the given [F]ile (possibly with [R]ead/[W]rite permissions),
e[X]ecutable (in $PATH), or the [I]mage (in ImagePath).

Example:

-------
AddToFunc StartFunction I Test (Init) Exec exec xterm

AddToFunc VerifyVersion
+ I Test (Version 2.5.*) Echo 2.5.x detected
+ I TestRc (NoMatch) \
        Test (!Version 2.6.*) Echo Future version
+ I TestRc (NoMatch) \
        Echo 2.6.x is detected

Test (F $[FVWM_USERDIR]/local-config) Read local-config
Test (X xterm-utf16) Exec exec xterm-utf16
