'Break' [levels]::

If the break command is used in a function, function execution is
terminated immediately. Further commands of the function are not
processed. Normally, all nested invocations of complex functions are left.
An optional integer number levels may be given to break out of the given
number of nested functions and continue execution of a higher level
function. The Break command always has the return code -2. Example:

------
AddToFunc PickWindowRaiseAndDeiconify
+ I Pick
+ I TestRc (Error) Break
+ I Raise
+ I Iconify off
------
