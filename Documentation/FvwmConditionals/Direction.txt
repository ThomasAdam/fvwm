'Direction' [FromPointer] direction [(conditions)] command::
+
Performs command (typically Focus) on a window in the given direction
which satisfies all conditions. Normally, the center of the currently
focused window or the context window in which the command was invoked is
taken as the starting point. Lacking such a window, or when the
FromPointer option is given, the current position of the pointer is taken
as the starting point. The direction may be one of "North", "Northeast",
"East", "Southeast", "South", "Southwest", "West", "Northwest" and
"Center". Which window Direction selects depends on angle and distance
between the center points of the windows. Closer windows are considered a
better match than those farther away. The Center direction simply selects
the window closest to the starting point. Returns -1 if an invalid
direction was given. See the Conditions section for a list of conditions.
