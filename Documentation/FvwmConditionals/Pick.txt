'Pick' [(conditions)] command::

Pick works like Function if invoked in the context of a window. If invoked
in the root window, it first asks the user to pick a window and then
executes the command in the context of that window. This avoids annoying
multiple selections with complex functions. The command is executed only
if the given conditions are met. Returns -1 if no window was selected. See
Conditions section for a list of conditions.

This command implies the conditions CirculateHit, CirculateHitIcon and
CirculateHitShaded. They can be turned off by specifying !CirculateHit
etc. explicitly.
