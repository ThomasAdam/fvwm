'ScanForWindow' [FromPointer] dir1 dir2 [(conditions)] command::
+
Performs command (typically Focus) on a window in the given direction
which satisfies all conditions. Normally, the center of the currently
focused window or the context window in which the command was invoked is
taken as the starting point. Lacking such a window, or when the
FromPointer option is given, the current position of the pointer is taken
as the starting point. The direction dir1 may be one of "North",
"NorthEast", "East", "SouthEast", "South", "SouthWest", "West", and
"NorthWest". Which window ScanForWindow selects depends first on the
position along the primary axis given by dir1. If any windows have the
exact same coordinate along the primary axis, the secondary direction is
used to order the windows. The direction dir2 may be one of the same set
of values as dir1. If dir2 is not perfectly perpendicular to dir1,
ScanForWindow returns a failure. When using ScanForWindow repeatedly with
the same arguments, it is guaranteed that all windows matching the
conditions will eventually be found. If the focus reaches a limit along
the primary axis, it will wrap around to the opposite side. Returns -1 if
an invalid direction was given. See Conditions section for a list of
conditions.
