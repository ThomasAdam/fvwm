'State' state [bool]::

Sets, clears or toggles one of the 32 user defined states which are
associated with each window. The state is a number ranging from 0 to 31.
The states have no meaning in fvwm, but they can be checked in conditional
commands like Next with the State condition. The optional argument bool is
a boolean argument. "True" sets the given state, while "False" clears it.
Using "toggle" switches to the opposite state. If the bool argument is not
given, the state is toggled.
