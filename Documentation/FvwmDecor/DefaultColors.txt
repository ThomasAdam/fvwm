'DefaultColors' [foreground] [background]::

DefaultColors sets the default foreground and background colors used in
miscellaneous windows created by fvwm, for example in the geometry
feedback windows during a move or resize operation. If you do not want to
change one color or the other, use - as its color name. To revert to the
built-in default colors omit both color names. Note that the default
colors are not used in menus, window titles or icon titles.
