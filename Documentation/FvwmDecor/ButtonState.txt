'ButtonState' [ActiveDown bool] [Inactive bool] [InactiveDown bool]::
+
The ButtonState command controls which states of the window titles and
title buttons are used. The default is to use all four states:
"ActiveUp>", "ActiveDown>", "InactiveUp>" and "InactiveDown>" (see
ButtonStyle and TitleStyle commands). The bool argument after the key word
controls if the designated state is used ("True") or not ("False"). The
"ActiveUp" state cannot be deactivated. If no arguments are provided or
the given arguments are illegal, the default is restored.
+
If ActiveDown argument is "False", no different button style for the
pressed down buttons used, instead "ActiveUp" state is used even when
button is pressed.
+
If Inactive argument is "False", focused and unfocused windows look
similarly, the corresponding "Active" states are always used.
+
If InactiveDown argument is "False" (only applied when Inactive is
"True"), the pressed titles and title buttons in non-focused windows are
drawn using "InactiveUp" or "ActiveUp" states depending on the values of
the other key words.
