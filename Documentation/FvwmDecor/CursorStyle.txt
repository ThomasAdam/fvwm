The defaults are shown in parentheses above. If you ever want to restore
the default cursor for a specific context you can omit the second
argument.

The second argument is either the numeric value of the cursor as defined
in the include file X11/cursorfont.h or its name (without the XC_ prefix).
Alternatively, the xpm file name may be specified. The name can also be
None (no cursor) or Tiny (a single pixel as the cursor).

-------
# make the kill cursor be XC_gumby (both forms work):
CursorStyle DESTROY 56
CursorStyle DESTROY gumby
-------

Alternatively, the cursor can be loaded from an (XPM, PNG or SVG) image
file. If fvwm is compiled with Xcursor support, full ARGB is used, and
(possibly animated) cursor files made with the xcursorgen program can be
loaded. Otherwise the cursor is converted to monochrome.

The optional x and y arguments (following a file argument) specifies the
hot-spot coordinate with 0 0 as the top left corner of the image.
Coordinates within the image boundary are valid and overrides any hot-spot
defined in the (XPM/Xcursor) image file. An invalid or undefined hot-spot
is placed in the center of the image.

------
CursorStyle ROOT cursor_image.png 0 0

The optional fg and bg arguments specify the foreground and background
colors for the cursor, defaulting to black and white (reverse video
compared to the actual bitmap). These colors are only used with monochrome
cursors. Otherwise they are silently ignored.
