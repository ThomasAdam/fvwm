'AddToDecor' decor::
+
This command is deprecated and will be removed in the future. There are
plans to replace it with a more flexible solution in fvwm-3.0.
+
Add or divert commands to the decor named decor. A decor is a name given
to the set of commands which affect button styles, title-bar styles and
border styles. If decor does not exist it is created; otherwise the
existing decor is modified. Note: Earlier versions allowed to use the
HilightColor, HilightColorset and WindowFont commands in decors. This is
no longer possible. Please use the Style command with the Hilight... and
Font options.
+
New decors start out exactly like the "default" decor without any style
definitions. A given decor may be applied to a set of windows with the
UseDecor option of the Style command. Modifying an existing decor affects
all windows which are currently assigned to it.
+
AddToDecor is similar in usage to the AddToMenu and AddToFunc commands,
except that menus and functions are replaced by ButtonStyle,
AddButtonStyle, TitleStyle, AddTitleStyle and BorderStyle commands. Decors
created with AddToDecor can be manipulated with ChangeDecor, DestroyDecor,
UpdateDecor and the Style option.
+
The following example creates a decor "FlatDecor" and style "FlatStyle".
They are distinct entities:

         BackColor grey40, HilightFore black, HilightBack grey70

An existing window's decor may be reassigned with ChangeDecor. A decor can
be destroyed with DestroyDecor.
