'AddButtonStyle' button [state] [style] [-- [!]flag... ]::
+
Adds a button style to button. button can be a button number, or one of
"All", "Left" or "Right". state can be "ActiveUp", "ActiveDown",
"InactiveUp" or "InactiveDown", or "Active" (the same as both "ActiveUp"
and "ActiveDown") or "Inactive" (the same as both "InactiveUp" and
"InactiveDown") or any of these 6 with "Toggled" prepended. The "Active"
states apply to the focused window, the "Inactive" ones apply to all other
windows. The "Up" states apply to the non pressed buttons, the "Down" ones
apply to pressed buttons. The "Toggled" prefix refers to maximized, shaded
or sticky windows that have the corresponding MwmDecor... button style
set. Additionally, the following shortcuts may be used: "AllNormal",
"AllToggled", "AllActive", "AllInactive", "AllUp", "AllDown". They are
actually different masks for 4 individual states from 8 total. These are
supported too: "AllActiveUp", "AllActiveDown", "AllInactiveUp",
"AllInactiveDown".
+
If state is omitted, then the style is added to every state. If the style
and flags are enclosed in parentheses, then multiple state definitions can
be placed on a single line. Flags for additional button styles cannot be
changed after definition.
+
Buttons are drawn in the order of definition, beginning with the most
recent button style, followed by those added with AddButtonStyle. To clear
the button style stack, change style flags, or for descriptions of
available styles and flags, see the ButtonStyle command. Examples:
+
-----
ButtonStyle 1 Pixmap led.xpm -- Top Left
ButtonStyle 1 ActiveDown HGradient 8 grey black
ButtonStyle All --  UseTitleStyle
AddButtonStyle 1 \
         ActiveUp (Pixmap a.xpm) \
         ActiveDown (Pixmap b.xpm -- Top)
AddButtonStyle 1 Vector 4 50x30@1 70x70@0 30x70@0 50x30@1
------

Initially for this example all button states are set to a pixmap. The
second line replaces the "ActiveDown" state with a gradient (it overrides
the pixmap assigned to it in the line before, which assigned the same
style to every state). Then, the UseTitleStyle flag is set for all
buttons, which causes fvwm to draw any styles set with TitleStyle before
drawing the buttons. Finally, AddButtonStyle is used to place additional
pixmaps for both "ActiveUp" and "ActiveDown" states and a vector button
style is drawn on top of all states.
