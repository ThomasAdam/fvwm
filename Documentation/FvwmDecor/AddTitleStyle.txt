'AddTitleStyle' [state] [style] [-- [!]flag... ]::

Adds a title style to the title-bar. state can be "ActiveUp",
"ActiveDown", "InactiveUp" or "InactiveDown", or "Active" (the same as
both "ActiveUp" and "ActiveDown") or "Inactive" (the same as both
"InactiveUp" and "InactiveDown") or any of these 6 with "Toggled"
prepended. If state is omitted, then the style is added to every state. If
the style and flags are enclosed in parentheses, then multiple state
definitions can be placed on a single line. This command is quite similar
to the AddButtonStyle command.

Title-bars are drawn in the order of definition, beginning with the most
recent TitleStyle, followed by those added with AddTitleStyle. To clear
the title style stack, change style flags, or for the descriptions of
available styles and flags, see the TitleStyle and ButtonStyle commands.
