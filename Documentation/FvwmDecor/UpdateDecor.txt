'UpdateDecor' [decor]::

This command is deprecated and will be removed in the future. There are
plans to replace it with a more flexible solution in fvwm-3.0.

This command is kept mainly for backward compatibility. Since all elements
of a decor are updated immediately when they are changed, this command is
mostly useless.

Updates window decorations. decor is an optional argument which specifies
the decor to update. If given, only windows which are assigned to that
particular decor are updated. This command is useful, for instance, after
a ButtonStyle, TitleStyle or BorderStyle (possibly used in conjunction
with AddToDecor). Specifying an invalid decor results in all windows being
updated. This command is less disturbing than Recapture, but does not
affect window style options as Recapture does.
