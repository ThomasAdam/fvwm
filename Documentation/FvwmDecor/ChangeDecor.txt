'ChangeDecor' decor::

This command is deprecated and will be removed in the future. There are
plans to replace it with a more flexible solution in fvwm-3.0.

Changes the decor of a window to decor. decor is "Default" or the name of
a decor defined with AddToDecor. If decor is invalid, nothing occurs. If
called from somewhere in a window or its border, then that window is
affected. If called from the root window the user is allowed to select the
target window. ChangeDecor only affects attributes which can be set using
the AddToDecor command.
