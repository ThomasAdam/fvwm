'DestroyDecor' [recreate] decor::

This command is deprecated and will be removed in the future. There are
plans to replace it with a more flexible solution in fvwm-3.0.

Deletes the decor defined with AddToDecor, so that subsequent references
to it are no longer valid. Windows using this decor revert to the
"Default" decor. The optional parameter recreate tells fvwm not to throw
away the decor completely but to throw away only its contents. If the
decor is created again later, windows do not use it before the UseDecor
style is applied again unless the decor was destroyed with the recreate
option. The decor named "Default" cannot be destroyed.
