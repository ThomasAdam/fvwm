'Module' modulename [moduleparams]::
+
Specifies a module with its optional parameters which should be spawned.
Currently several modules, including FvwmButtons, FvwmEvent, FvwmForm,
FvwmGtk, FvwmPager, FvwmScript support aliases. Aliases are useful if more
than one instance of the module should be spawned. Aliases may be
configured separately using * syntax. To start a module FvwmForm using an
alias MyForm, the following syntax may be used:
+
----
Module FvwmForm MyForm
----
+
At the current time the available modules (included with fvwm) are
FvwmAnimate (produces animation effects when a window is iconified or
de-iconified), FvwmAuto (an auto raise module), FvwmBacker (to change the
background when you change desktops), FvwmBanner (to display a spiffy XBM,
XPM, PNG or SVG), FvwmButtons (brings up a customizable tool bar),
FvwmCommandS (a command server to use with shell's FvwmCommand client),
FvwmConsole (to execute fvwm commands directly), FvwmCpp (to preprocess
your config with cpp), FvwmDebug (to help debug fvwm), FvwmDragWell (the
place to drag&drop to), FvwmEvent (trigger various actions by events),
FvwmForm (to bring up dialogs), FvwmGtk (to bring up GTK menus and

Modules can be short lived transient programs or, like FvwmButtons , can
remain for the duration of the X session. Modules are terminated by the
window manager prior to restarts and quits, if possible. See the
introductory section on modules. The keyword Module may be omitted if
modulename is distinct from all fvwm commands.
