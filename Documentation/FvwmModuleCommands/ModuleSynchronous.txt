ModuleSynchronous

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   ModuleSynchronous [Expect string] [Timeout secs] modulename

   The ModuleSynchronous command is very similar to Module. Fvwm stops
   processing any commands and user input until the module sends a string
   beginning with "NOP FINISHED STARTUP" back to fvwm. If the optional
   Timeout is given fvwm gives up if the module sent no input back to fvwm
   for secs seconds. If the Expect option is given, fvwm waits for the given
   string instead. ModuleSynchronous should only be used during fvwm startup
   to enforce the order in which modules are started. This command is
   intended for use with the (currently hypothetical) module that should be
   in place before other modules are started.

   Warning: It is quite easy to hang fvwm with this command, even if a
   timeout is given. Be extra careful choosing the string to wait for.
   Although all modules in the fvwm distribution send back the "NOP FINISHED
   STARTUP" string once they have properly started up, this may not be the
   case for third party modules. Moreover, you can try to escape from a
   locked ModuleSynchronous command by using the key sequence Ctrl-Alt-Escape
   (see the EscapeFunc).
