'ModuleListenOnly' modulename [moduleparams]::
+
This command works like the Module command, but fvwm never sends any
messages to the module. This may be handy to write a module as a shell
script that is triggered by external events without the burden to answer
packets sent by fvwm. For example, a module written as a shell script may
change labels of the FvwmButtons module to implement a simple clock.
