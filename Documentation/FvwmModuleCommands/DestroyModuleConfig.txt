DestroyModuleConfig

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   DestroyModuleConfig module_config

   Deletes module configuration entries, so that new configuration lines may
   be entered instead. This also sometimes the only way to turn back some
   module settings, previously defined. This changes the way a module runs
   during a fvwm session without restarting. Wildcards can be used for
   portions of the name as well.

   The new non-conflicting syntax allows a delimiter, a colon and optional
   spaces between the module name and the rest of the line. In this case a
   module name (or alias) can't have wildcards.
