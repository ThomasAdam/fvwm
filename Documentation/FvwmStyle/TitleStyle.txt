TitleStyle

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   TitleStyle [justification] [Height [num]] [MinHeight [num]]

   Sets attributes for the title-bar. Justifications can be Centered,
   RightJustified or LeftJustified. Height sets the title bar's height to an
   amount in pixels. MinHeight sets the minimal height in pixels of the title
   bar. Defaults are Centered, the window's font height and no minimal
   height. To reset the font height to the default value, omit the num
   argument after the Height keyword. The MinHeight height is reseted by
   Height or if given with no argument. Example:

 TitleStyle LeftJustified Height 24

   TitleStyle [state] [style] [-- [!]flag... ]

   Sets the style for the title-bar. See also AddTitleStyle and ButtonStyle
   state can be one of "ActiveUp", "ActiveDown", "InactiveUp", or
   "InactiveDown". Shortcuts like "Active" and "Inactive" are allowed. The
   states with the "Toggled" prefix are allowed too, the title itself does
   not use "Toggled" states, but these states are used for the buttons with
   ButtonStyle UseTitleStyle. If state is omitted, then the style is added to
   every state. If parentheses are placed around the style and flags, then
   multiple state definitions can be given per line. style can be omitted so
   that flags can be set while not destroying the current style.

   If a '!' is prefixed to any flag, its behavior is negated. Valid flags for
   each state include Raised, Flat and Sunk (these are mutually exclusive).
   The default is Raised. See the note in ButtonStyle regarding the
   "ActiveDown" state. Examples:

 TitleStyle ActiveUp HGradient 16 navy black
 TitleStyle \
         ActiveDown (Solid red -- flat) \
         Inactive (TiledPixmap wood.xpm)
 TitleStyle \
         ActiveUp (-- Flat) \
         ActiveDown (-- Raised) \
         InactiveUp (-- Flat) \
         InactiveDown (-- Sunk)

   This sets the "ActiveUp" state to a horizontal gradient, the "ActiveDown"
   state to solid red, and the "Inactive" states to a tiled wood pixmap.
   Finally, "ActiveUp" and "InactiveUp" are set to look flat, while
   "ActiveDown" set to be sunk (the Raised flag for the "ActiveDown" state
   causes it to appear sunk due to relief inversion), and "InactiveDown" is
   set to look raised. An example which sets flags for all states:

 TitleStyle -- flat

   For a flattened look:

 TitleStyle -- flat
 ButtonStyle All Active (-- flat) Inactive (-- flat)

   TitleStyle accepts all the ButtonStyle styles and arguments:

   Simple, Default, Solid, Colorset, Vector, ?Gradient, Pixmap,
   AdjustedPixmap, ShrunkPixmap, StretchedPixmap, TiledPixmap, MiniIcon.

   See the ButtonStyle command for a description of all these styles and
   their arguments.

   In addition to these styles TitleStyle accepts a powerful MultiPixmap
   option. This allows you to specify different pixmaps, colorsets or colors
   for different parts of the titlebar. Some of them are tiled or stretched
   to fit a particular space; others are discrete "transition" images. The
   definable sections are:

   Main

           The full titlebar

   LeftMain

           Left of title text

   RightMain

           Right of title text

   UnderText

           Underneath title text

   LeftOfText

           just to the left of the title text

   RightOfText

           just to the right of the title text

   LeftEnd

           at the far left end of the titlebar (just after left buttons if
           any)

   RightEnd

           at the far right end of the titlebar (just before right buttons if
           any)

   Buttons

           under buttons in case of UseTitleStyle

   LeftButtons

           under left buttons in case of UseTitleStyle

   RightButtons

           under right buttons in case of UseTitleStyle

   None of these are mandatory except for Main (or, if you do not define Main
   you must define both LeftMain and RightMain). If no Buttons pixmaps are
   defined and UseTitleStyle is specified for one or more buttons, Main,
   LeftMain or RightMain are used as appropriate.

   The syntax for this style type is:

 MultiPixmap section style arg, ...

   continuing for whatever you want to define. The style can be either
   TiledPixmap, AdjustedPixmap, Colorset or Solid. See the ButtonStyle
   command for the description of these styles. In the case of a transition
   section, LeftEnd, LeftOfText, RightOfText or RightEnd, AdjustedPixmap only
   resize the pixmap in the "y" direction. For the Colorset and Solid styles
   a width of the half of the title bar height is assumed for the transition
   sections.

   An example:

 MultiPixmap Main AdjustedPixmap foo.xpm, \
             UnderText TiledPixmap bar.xpm, \
             Buttons Colorset 2

   Note that the old syntax is still supported: if the style is omitted,
   TiledPixmap is assumed and adding "(stretched)" between the section and
   the file name implies AdjustedPixmap.
