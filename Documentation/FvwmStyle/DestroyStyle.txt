'DestroyStyle' style::
+
Deletes the style named style. The changes take effect immediately. Note
that style is not a wild-carded search string, but rather a case-sensitive
string that should exactly match the original Style command.
+
Destroying style "*" can be done, but isn't really to be recommended. For
example:
+
-----
DestroyStyle Application*
-----
+
This removes all settings for the style named "Application*", NOT all
styles starting with "Application".
