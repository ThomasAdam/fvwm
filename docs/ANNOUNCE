Who needs to upgrade?
---------------------

Everyone who needs a support or experiences a problem with earlier
2.4.x versions.  Like the previous versions, this one includes
some synchronization syntax enhancements with 2.5.x versions that
will be suggested on the support mailing lists, so the sooner
users upgrade the sooner they could use the suggested solutions.
System administrators are encouraged to install this version to
grant their users an access to the latest stable version.

Bug Fixes:
----------

* Fixed error message for incorrect --with-SOME-library argument.

* Fixed a compile problem on QNX 4.25.

* The "Visible" condition does no longer select windows on
  different desks.

* Fixed sending M_NEW_PAGE packets to the modules if the page did
  not change.

* With the styles StartsOnPage, SkipMapping and UsePPosition,
  windows that request a specific position are still placed on the
  given page.

Improvements:
-------------

* It is now possible to suppress title action or title completely
  in menus created by fvwm-menu-directory.

* New configure switch --disable-gtk.

* FvwmGtk.1 is not installed if FvwmGtk is not built.

* Added support for new BBC headlines in fvwm-menu-headlines, this
  replaces the old BBC-Worlds and BBC-SciTech headlines.
