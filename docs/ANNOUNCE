The FVWM-Workers list is pleased to announce FVWM version 2.4 "F2K"
%% domivogt: Ha ha ha 8-). "F2K" reminds me a bit of "F**k"
%% domivogt: how about "Fvwm 3000 - The window manager of the next millenium"
%% domivogt: ;-)
%% dan: No, how about F2K,  like thanks a lot for asking over and over whether
        fvwm was complaint, and making sure I was at work on New Years Eve. :)

Available at http://www.fvwm.org/ it includes the following

Highlights:

 ** A new "Themes" module called FvwmTheme and "colorsets" including
    8 kinds of gradients and pixmap support controlling the appearance
    of borders, titlebars, frames, 3D shadows, menus and modules.

 ** Gnome compliance as a compile time option.

 ** ICCCM2 compliance.

 ** Optional session management.

 ** FvwmAnimate support in FvwmIconBox, FvwmIconMan, FvwmTaskBar, and
    FvwmWinList.

 ** Mouse stroke support.
    You will need the libstroke library, found at
    http://www.etla.net/~willey/projects/libstroke/

 ** Titlebars at the bottom or the top of windows with the
    TitleAtBottom and TitleAtTop styles.

 ** The root cursor now indicates when Fvwm is busy.

 ** New command to configure a way to abort Fvwm.
%% domivogt: What does this mean? Which command?
%% dan: beats me.

 ** Dynamically generated menus and some menu generating scripts.

 ** Much more flexibility and control in menu definition.

 ** Starting Fvwm without a config file now really works.

 ** For many users, the ModulePath and ImagePath commands will become
    unnecessary.  Both can be built in.  User specified ModulePath and
    ImagePath can add on to the built in paths.

 ** Key and mouse bindings and style commands take effect immediately,
    recapture is no longer needed to make most changes.

 ** Most users can remove the ColorLimit command.  It takes the best
    setting depending on the color depth.

 ** Control over mouse pointer colors and pixmap pointers.

 ** New module FvwmGtk for Gtk style menus.

 ** VMS port.
%% domivogt: we should definitely try it out first!

 ** Animated window shading with the WindowShadeAnimate command.

 ** Layers.
%% domivogt: we need an introduction about layers somewhere

 ** The WindowList command has options to allow better
    control of which windows are shown.

 ** Using alt-tab now works exactly like the other one.

More detailed information on the contents of this release can be

You will  probably  have   to make   the following   changes  to  your
configuration file:

Recapture should be removed from any style changing code.

"HilightColor fore/back" becomes
"sytle "*" Hilightfore fore, HilightBack back"

"WindowFont font" becomes
"Style "*" Font font"

IconPath/PixmapPath becomes
ImagePath
The directories from both statements should be merged,
any directories built in should be removed,
and a plus sign should be added to the end.

In most cases, the ModulePath statement can be removed
or treated like the ImagePath.

Users should consider removing any alt-tab binding they have over
the builtin binding.

The Colorlimit command can be removed.
