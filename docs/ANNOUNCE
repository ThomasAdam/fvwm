Over two busy years have passed since fvwm 2.2 was released. Bugs,
floods, and cats had to be mastered, but:

The people on the FVWM-Workers list are very pleased to announce

Available at http://www.fvwm.org/ it includes the following


Highlights:
-----------

 ** A new "Theme" module called FvwmTheme and "colour sets"
    including 8 kinds of gradients and pixmap support controlling
    the appearance of borders, title bars, frames, 3D shadows,
    menus and modules.

 ** GNOME compliance.
    GNOME hints can be turned on and off for individual windows.

 ** Mouse stroke support.
    You will need the libstroke library, found at
    http://www.etla.net/~willey/projects/libstroke/

 ** Much more flexibility and control in menu definition and menu
    styles including dynamically generated menus and some menu
    generating scripts.

 ** Almost all commands, including Key, Mouse and Style, take
    effect immediately.  The Recapture command is no longer needed
    to activate most changes.

 ** The old StaysOnTop style option has been generalised into the
    concept of layers.  See the fvwm2 man page for details.

 ** Using Alt-Tab now works exactly like the other one.

 ** A derived package fvwm-themes standardises FVWM Themes issues.
    More info in http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/.

 ** Improved multi head support.

 ** A follow up release supporting Xinerama is planned soon.

And more:
---------

 ** The root cursor now indicates when Fvwm is busy.

 ** New module FvwmGtk for Gtk style menus and dialogs.

 ** FvwmAnimate support in FvwmIconBox, FvwmIconMan, FvwmTaskBar,
    and FvwmWinList.

 ** Control over mouse pointer colours and pixmap pointers.
    More CursorStyle contexts.

 ** New command to configure a way to abort Fvwm waiting.
    Look at EscapeFunc in the fvwm2 man page.

 ** Animated window shading with the WindowShadeSteps window
    style.

 ** Title-bars at the bottom or the top of windows with the
    TitleAtBottom and TitleAtTop styles.

 ** The WindowList command has options to allow better
    control of which windows are shown.

 ** Session management support.

 ** Experimental multi byte font support with the
    --enable-multibyte configure option.

 ** A shell script to convert old 2.2 configuration files into
    2.4 syntax: fvwm24_convert.

 ** User configuration is now searched in $HOME/.fvwm by default.

 ** A non conflicting and more readable syntax for module
    configs: "*FvwmPager: DeskTopScale 32"

 ** For most of users, the ModulePath and ImagePath commands will
    become unnecessary.  Both can be built in.  User specified
    ModulePath and ImagePath can add on to the built in paths.

 ** Most users can remove the ColorLimit command.  It takes the
    best setting depending on the colour depth.

 ** Output of the configure script is more understandable.

 ** When fvwm is run remotely, startup is noticeably faster.

 ** VMS port.

 ** Killing modules running under an alias now works.

 ** ICCCM2 compliance.

A full list of all new and changed features follows at the end of
this document.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Suggested changes to your configuration file:
---------------------------------------------

 - All fvwm user configurations should be moved to $HOME/.fvwm
   directory; Read command supports $HOME/.fvwm by default, but
   not $HOME.

 - Recapture can be removed from any style changing code.

 - "HilightColor fore/back" becomes
   "Style * Hilightfore fore, HilightBack back"

 - "HilightColorset colorset" becomes
   "Style * HilightColorset colorset"

 - "WindowShadeAnimate steps" becomes
   "Style * WindowShadeSteps steps"

 - "WindowFont font" becomes
   "Style * Font font"

 - "IconPath" / "PixmapPath" becomes
   "ImagePath"
   The directories from both statements should be merged, any
   directories built in could be removed, and a plus sign should
   be added to the end.

 - In most cases, the ModulePath statement can be removed or
   treated like the ImagePath.

 - Users should consider removing any alt-tab binding they have
   over the builtin binding.

 - The Colorlimit command can be removed.

 - The FvwmGoodStuff module is obsoleted by FvwmButtons.  If you
   are using FvwmGoodStuff, you need to recode this part of your
   configuration.

 - The GlobalOpts command has become Style options and the BugOpts
   command.  Please refer to the GlobalOpts command in the man
   page for details.

 - Most of these configuration files changes can be done using the
   new fvwm24_convert command that comes with fvwm.

   and RestartFuction can be moved to the new StartFunction.
 * New function variables $c, $r, $n.

   using Restart without any parameters and wonder why changes
   in your configuration file are not used during a restart you

   called instead of {Init|Restart|Exit}Function when running
   under a session manager.

   (the old one) and MinOverlapPercentPlacement.

   control if the transients of a window are raised when the
   window itself is raised (default) or not.
 * New style DepressableBorder/FirmBorder to influence the
   appearance of the window border under button presses.
 * New style IconOverride/NoIconOverride/NoActiveIconOverride to
   influence the overriding behaviour of the Icon style.
 * GrabFocusTransient is a new style that does the same as
   GrabFocus, but only for transient windows.

   and Hilight3DThickness (MenuStyle).  Menu behaviour can be
   mirrored with the SumbenusLeft option (hard to describe, it's
   best to try it out).  A menu item can get up to three different
   labels.  The first two are left aligned, the third is right
   aligned by default.
 * New menu styles HoldSubmenus/DeleteSubmenus.  HoldSubmenus is
   the new default for mwm and fvwm menus.  When you move back
   from a submenu to its parent menu the submenu remains visible.
 * Menus can be visible multiple times at once.

   that Next/Prev will take, Prev goes down the list, Next goes up
