The F???? Virtual Window Manager workers list is pleased to
announce the new official beta test version of Fvwm2 (version
number 2.1.12). Available at

  http://www.fvwm.org/

it includes the following features (entries with '+' are new in
this beta):

+) Some tricky bugfixes.
*) New syntax for menu styles (MenuStyle) with greatly improved
   configurability (the SetMenuStyle command from previous betas
   has been merged into MenuStyle, please make sure to change
   your .fvwm2rc on that).
*) The growing windows bug from the last betas has been fixed
   (if you see it again, please contact fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu).
*) AutoHide bugfixes for FvwmTaskBar (EdgeThickness command).
*) New commands DefaultFont, DefaultColors and Emulate. The
   SetMenuDelay command from the previous betas has been removed.
*) New web site, overhauled documentation and a new Bug tracking
   system.
*) Improved menu handling with animated menus, improved cursor
   key navigation, individual menu styles and better overall
   flexibility.
*) Enhanced window and focus handling (SnapAttraction and
   Direction commands).
*) New commands for desks and pages (MoveToPage, MoveToDesk,
   FvwmPager showing the current desk).
*) Proper Windoze95 style Alt-Tab behaviour with WindowList
   command.
*) Animated iconification and window movement and animated panels
   in FvwmButtons (like CDE).

   backward compatibility.

Beta testers needed urgently:
=============================

You like fvwm and want to help? Become a beta tester. You can just
download the distribution and run your latest setup with the new
beta, but I you feel like doing something really helpful, pick an
area from the following list, try to test it as completely as you
can and report your test setup to the fvwm-workers mailing list:

  <fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu>

 - Compile fvwm2 on as many different platforms and with as many
   combinations of options as you can (see INSTALL.fvwm for a
   list of options).

 - Try to break fvwm with exotic setups and syntax errors in the
   configuration file.

 - Play with the new menu features (animated menus, individual
   menu styles, position hints, cursor key movement etc.)

 - Test the new features in FvwmButtons (animated panels, button
   geometries, button placement algorithm). Panels are somewhat
   difficult to understand so please read the manpage (there are
   some examples).

 - Thorough test of FvwmPager. The configuration parser has been
   changed so every option should be tested.

 - Thorough test of FvwmIconMan. The configuration parser has
   been changed so every option should be tested.

 - Test the new module FvwmAnimate.

 - Test the new module FvwmEvent.
