the list below.

Improvements and compatibility issues:
--------------------------------------

* Restored old way of handling clicks in windows with ClickToFocus
  and ClickToFocusPassesClickOff.  This fixes a problem with
  click+drag in an unfocused rxvt or aterm window.

* DESTDIR may be fully used again (only useful for distributors).

* Applications using Mwm hints can now enforce that a window can
  not be moved.

* fvwm-menu-headlines: added support for CNN and BBC headlines.


Bug fixes:
----------

* Fixed interaction bug between CascadePlacement and StartsOnPage -
  if the target page was at a negative x or y page displacement
  from the current viewport, the window would be placed on the
  wrong page.

* Fixed a problem with colormap transition when a transient window
  died.

* Fixed a FvwmScript crash with Swallow widget and very long window
  names.

* Fixed problems with $fg and $bg variables in FvwmButtons when the
  UseOld option was used.

* Fixed wrong warp coordinates when WarpToWindow was used with two
  arguments on an unmanaged window.

* Added a workaround for popup menus in TK applications that appear
  on some random position.

* Fixed problems with wish scripts creating windows that start
  iconic.

* Fixed the NoClose option with unmapped panels in FvwmButtons.

* A number of drawing fixes in FvwmPager.

* Fixed a slight bug when waiting until all buttons are released,
  for example after executing a complex function.

* Fixed potentially harmful change in module interface.

* Fixed displaying menu items with icons when using the MenuStyle
  SubmmenusLeft.

* Fixed problems with the pointer moving off screen in a multi
  head setup.

* Fixed a potential crash with windows being destroyed during a
  recapture operation.

* Fixed a memory leak in some modules when not using glibc.

* Fixed negative arguments of WarpToWindow when used on an
  unmanaged window.

* Fixed a key binding problem with key symbols that are generated
  by several keys.

* Fixed a possible crash when a window was recaptured and the
  focus could not be transfered to another window.

* Fixed a performance problem with large numbers of mouse binding
  commands.
