fvwm is a powerful window manager.  Version 2.5.8 is an unstable
release that includes improvements over unstable 2.5.7 and stable
2.4.17 versions.  You are welcome to upgrade and test the new
features or help stabilizing the code.  Please be aware that any
features introduced in the 2.5.x development versions may be
renamed, changed or removed without notice before 2.6.0.

This release is available at the home page: http://www.fvwm.org/.
We are 10 years old now as of Juny 2003!

Improvements:
-------------

* The Break command can be told the number of nested function
  levels to break out of.  Break now has a return code of -2
  ("Break").

* New extended variable $[func.context].

* Directions can be abbreviated with -, _, [, ], <, >, v or ^ like
  in key or mouse bindings.

* fvwm now handles what Unicode calls "combining characters" (i.e.
  marks drawn on top of other characters).

* FvwmAnimate now supports dynamical commands "pause", "play",
  "push", "pop" and "reset" to manipulate the playing state.

New features:
-------------

* New commands WindowStyle and DestroyWindowStyle for individual
  (per window) styles.

* fvwm supports tear off menus.  See the "Tear Off Menus" section
  in the man page or press Backspace on any menu to try them out.

* New Style option MoveByProgramMethod.  Tries to autodetect
  whether application windows are moved honouring the ICCCM or not
  (default).  The method can be overridden manually if the
  detection does not work.

* New prefix command KeepRc.

* Renamed the Cond command to TestRc, and the On command to Test.
  Removed the CondCase command.  Use "KeepRc TestRc" instead.

Other changes:
--------------

* Added a nice autohide script to the FAQ.

Bug Fixes:
----------

* The conditions !Current... and !Layer now work as expected.

See ChangeLog and NEWS (the 2.4.x section) files for all details.
