The FVWM-Workers list is pleased to announce FVWM version 2.4
Available at http://www.fvwm.org/ it includes the following

Highlights:
----------

 ** A new "Theme" module called FvwmTheme and "colorsets" including
    8 kinds of gradients and pixmap support controlling the appearance
    of borders, titlebars, frames, 3D shadows, menus and modules.

 ** ICCCM2 compliance.

 ** GNOME compliance.
    GNOME hints can be turned on and off for individual windows.

 ** Experimental session management support.

 ** FvwmAnimate support in FvwmIconBox, FvwmIconMan, FvwmTaskBar, and
    FvwmWinList.

 ** Mouse stroke support.
    You will need the libstroke library, found at
    http://www.etla.net/~willey/projects/libstroke/

 ** Titlebars at the bottom or the top of windows with the
    TitleAtBottom and TitleAtTop styles.

 ** The root cursor now indicates when Fvwm is busy.

 ** New command to configure a way to abort Fvwm waiting.
    Look at EscapeFunc in the fvwm2 man page.

 ** Dynamically generated menus and some menu generating scripts.

 ** Much more flexibility and control in menu definition.

 ** User configuration is now searched in $HOME/.fvwm by default.

 ** Starting Fvwm without a config file now really works.

 ** For most of users, the ModulePath and ImagePath commands will become
    unnecessary.  Both can be built in.  User specified ModulePath and
    ImagePath can add on to the built in paths.

 ** Key and mouse bindings and style commands take effect immediately,
    recapture is no longer needed to make most changes.

 ** Most users can remove the ColorLimit command.  It takes the best
    setting depending on the color depth.

 ** Control over mouse pointer colors and pixmap pointers.
    More CursorStyle contexts.

 ** New module FvwmGtk for Gtk style menus and dialogs.

 ** VMS port.
%% domivogt: we should definitely try it out first!
%% migo: especially FVWM_DATADIR/FVWM_USERDIR stuff, or it is hopeless?
%% dane: its hopeless and not important, it was working on VMS, if we
%% broke something, we'll fix it in 2.4.1. I'll remove this next time around.

 ** Animated window shading with the WindowShadeAnimate command.

 ** The old StaysOnTop style option has been generalized into the
    concept of layers.  See the fvwm2 man page for details.

 ** The WindowList command has options to allow better
    control of which windows are shown.

 ** Using Alt-Tab now works exactly like the other one.

 ** When fvwm is run remotely, startup is noticably faster.

 ** Killing modules running under an alias now works.

 ** A non conflicting and more readable syntax for module configs.
    *FvwmPager: DeskTopScale 32

 ** A derived package fvwm-themes standardizes FVWM Themes issues.

Suggested changes to your configuration file:
--------------------------------------------

All fvwm user configurations should be moved to $HOME/.fvwm
directory; Read command supports $HOME/.fvwm by default, but not $HOME.

Recapture can be removed from any style changing code.

"HilightColor fore/back" becomes
"Style * Hilightfore fore, HilightBack back"

"WindowFont font" becomes
"Style * Font font"

IconPath/PixmapPath becomes
ImagePath
The directories from both statements should be merged,
any directories built in could be removed,
and a plus sign should be added to the end.

In most cases, the ModulePath statement can be removed
or treated like the ImagePath.

Users should consider removing any alt-tab binding they have over
the builtin binding.

The Colorlimit command can be removed.

The FvwmGoodStuff module is obsoleted by FvwmButtons.
If you are using FvwmGoodStuff, you need to recode this part
of your configuration.

The GlobalOpts command has   become   Style options and the    BugOpts
command.

Most of these configuration files changes can be done using the new
fvwm24_convert command that comes with fvwm.
