Fvwm is a powerful window manager.  Version 2.5.28 is a beta
maintenance release that fixes a couple of bugs and adds some
minor features.  Please be aware that any features introduced in
the 2.5.x development versions may be renamed, changed or removed
without notice before 2.6.0.

Upgrading from 2.5.27 or earlier is recommended.

This release is available at the home page: http://www.fvwm.org/.

* New features:

   - New differentiated options for SnapAttraction when snapping
     against screen edges:
       "None", "ScreenWindows", "ScreenIcons", "ScreenAll"
   - New option to the BugOpts command: TransliterateUtf8.

* Bug fixes:

   - Fixed non-visible Qt windows after a Qt deferred map (e.g.
     Skype profile windows).
   - Fixed the use of the X-resource "fvwmstyle".
   - Fixed segmentation fault in FvwmEvent when parsing an
     undefined event name, or an undefined environment variable
     to the RPlayHost option.
   - Fixed the events startup, shutdown and unknown in FvwmEvent.
   - Fvwm now retains utf8 window names when the WM_NAME changes,
     and the utf8 name converted to the default charset match
     the old WM_NAME.
   - Fixed the options RPlayVolume and RPlayPriority in FvwmEvent.
   - Fixed SnapAttraction: Option SameType/Icons/Windows did
     falsely not affect conditions of option "Screen" and option
     "SameType" snapped falsely icons and windows together.
   - Fixed a problem where modules would get incorrect stacking
     information if many windows were restacked at the same time.
   - Fixed BugOpts parsing of more than one option at a time and
     restoring of default value for the last option
     in the command line when omitted.
   - 64 bit fix for setting EWMH _NET_WM_ICON property on windows.
