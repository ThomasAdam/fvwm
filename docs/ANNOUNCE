Fvwm is a powerful window manager.  Version 2.5.27 is a beta
maintenance release that fixes a couple of bugs and adds some
minor features.  Please be aware that any features introduced in
the 2.5.x development versions may be renamed, changed or removed
without notice before 2.6.0.

Upgrading from 2.5.26 or earlier is recommended.

This release is available at the home page: http://www.fvwm.org/.

* New features:

   - New extended variable
       $[w.visiblename]

   - Style matching now honours the window's visible name which
     means it can be matched before the real name, hence:

        Style $[w.visiblename] Colorset 5

        is now honoured.  Useful with IndexedWindowName as a style
        option.

   - New style InitialMapCommand allows to execute any command
     when a window is mapped first.

   - New option to PrintInfo, "bindings" which prints out all of
     the Key, PointerKey, Mouse and Stroke bindings which fvwm
     knows about.

* Bug fixes:

   - Fixed compilation without XRender support.
   - Fixed handling of _NET_MOVERESIZE_WINDOWS requests.
   - Fixed a bug in automatic detection mode of the style
     MoveByProgramMethod.
   - Fixed png detection when cross compiling.
   - Fixed keeping fullscreen window mode over a restart.
   - The style PositionPlacement now honours StartsOnPage.
   - Reset signal handlers for executed modules and programs.
   - Try to handle a bug an old version of the EWMH spec by
     honouring both, the _NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_HORIZ hint and
     the _NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_HORZ hitn.
   - Fix the GNOME location prefix to application .desktop files.
   - 'PositionPlacement UnderMouse' now forces the window
     on-screen, just like the old UnderMousePlacement style option
     used to.
