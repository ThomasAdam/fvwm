Fvwm is a powerful window manager.  Version 2.5.15 is a beta
release that fixes a couple of bugs and introduces a number of new
minor features.  You are welcome to upgrade and test the new
features or help stabilizing the code.  Please be aware that any
features introduced in the 2.5.x development versions may be
renamed, changed or removed without notice before 2.6.0.

2.5.15 fixes some bugs with the 64-bit architecture support.  For
64-bit support, upgrading from any earlier release is strongly
recommended.  Otherwise upgrading from any earlier 2.5.x release
is recommended.
