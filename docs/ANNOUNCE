FVWM is a powerful window manager.  Version 2.5.3 is an unstable
release that includes new features and improvements over unstable
2.5.2 and stable 2.4.9 versions.  You are welcome to upgrade and
test new features.

The release is available at the fvwm home page: http://www.fvwm.org/

Fixed:
------

* TitleStyle MultiPixmap now works once again.

* Restored old way of handling clicks in windows with ClickToFocus
  and ClickToFocusPassesClickOff.  This fixes a problem with
  click+drag in an unfocused rxvt or aterm window.

* Fixed interaction bug between CascadePlacement and StartsOnPage
  - if the target page was at a negative x or y page displacement
  from the current viewport, the window would be placed on the
  wrong page.

* Fixed wrong warp coordinates when WarpToWindow was used with two
  arguments on an unmanaged window.

New features:
-------------

* New Style option IconSize for restricting icon sizes.

* New WindowList options SortClassName, MaxLabelLength, NoLayer,
  ShowScreen, ShowPage, ShowPageX and ShowPageY.

* Vastly improved FvwmEvent performance.

* FvwmAuto can operate on Enter and Leave events too.  This makes
  it possible to have autoraising with ClickToFocus and
  NeverFocus. See -menter and -menterleave options and examples in
  the FvwmAuto man page.

* The "hangon" strings in FvwmButtons support wildcards.

* New option "Icon" to PlaceAgain command.

* New option "FromPointer" and direction "Center" to the Direction
  command.

* The styles ClickToFocusRaises(Off) and
  MouseFocusClickRaises(Off) are now different names for the same
  style.  Configurations that used

    Style * ClickToFocus, ClickToFocusRaises
    Style * MouseFocusClickRaisesOff

  or vice versa no longer work as like before.  Remove the second
  line to fix the problem.  ClickToFocusRaises now works only on
  the client part of a window, not on the decorations as it did
  before.

* New color limit method for screens that only display 256 colors
  (or less).

* In depth less or equal to 16 image and gradient can be
  dithered. This can be enabled/disabled by using the new
  dither/nodither options to the Colorset command.

* Many new focus policy styles "FP..." and "!FP...".

Removed:
--------

* Removed the old module interface for ConfigureWindow
  packets. External modules relying on this interface no longer
  work.

* Removed the styles MouseFocusClickIgnoreMotion and
  MouseFocusClickIgnoreMotionOff again.
