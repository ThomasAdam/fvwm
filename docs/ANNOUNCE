fvwm-2.4.18 maintenance release for all earlier 2.4.x versions.
It contains important security fixes in several scripts.

This release is available at the home page: http://www.fvwm.org/.

Who needs to upgrade?
---------------------

Because of the security issues with fvwm-2.3.4 to fvwm-2.4.17, it
is strongly recommended to upgrade to fvwm-2.4.18.

Everyone who needs a support or experiences a problem with earlier
2.4.x versions.  Like the previous versions, this one includes
some synchronization syntax enhancements with 2.5.x versions that
will be suggested on the support mailing lists, so the sooner
users upgrade the sooner they could use the suggested solutions.
System administrators are encouraged to install this version to
grant their users an access to the latest stable version.

* Corrected rebooting the machine in FvwmScript-Quit.
