Fvwm 2.4.6 is a maintenance release for 2.4.5.  Apart from fixing
a number of minor or rare problems, it addresses slow opaque
window movement and resizing that was not encountered in the 2.2.x
releases.  If yo do not use opaque window movement or resizing and
did not encounter any of the bugs described below you do not need
to upgrade.  System administrators are strongly encouraged to move
to 2.4.6 from any earlier 2.4.x release.

The release is available at the fvwm home page: http://www.fvwm.org/
