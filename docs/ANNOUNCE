FVWM is a powerful window manager.  Version 2.5.1 is a beta release
that includes new features and improvements over beta 2.5.0 and stable
2.4.7 versions.  You are welcome to upgrade and test new features.

The release is available at the fvwm home page: http://www.fvwm.org/

New features:
-------------

* Changed the executable and the man page names from fvwm2 to fvwm.
  The old names are still supported by symlinking.

* All fvwm utilities are renamed to conform to the "fvwm-" scheme.
  fvwm-bug, fvwm-root (was xpmroot), fvwm-config, fvwm-convert-2.4.

* Added a full support for the side window titles. New Style options
  TitleAtLeft and TitleAtRight added to TitleAtTop and TitleAtBottom.

* A title text may now be optionally rotated for both vertical and
  horizontal title directions, search for "Rotated" in the man page.

* Added support for loading images in PNG (including alpha blending)
  and XBM formats anywhere.

* New commands Schedule and Deschedule.

* New command State.  New conditions State and !State.

* New commands XSync and XSynchronize for debugging purposes.

* In interactive move/placement when Alt/Meta modifier is pressed, snap
  attraction (SnapAttraction, SnapGrid and EdgeResistance) is ignored.

* New flags (No)FvwmModule to FvwmButtons Swallow option

* The I18N_MB patch (--enable-multibyte) has been rewritten. MULTIBYTE
  is used to identify what is was I18N_MB. A set of locale functions
  (locale initialization, font loading, text drawing, ...etc.) is created
  in libs/Flocale.{c,h} and used in the entire fvwm code (but FvwmWharf).
  Font loading and memory management is improved in the multibyte case.

* Better support of non ISO-8859-1 window and icon titles. See the
  --disable-compound-text option in INSTALL.fvwm for more details.

* Added anti-aliased text rendering support using Xft (use --enable-xft
  to enable it). Recent versions of XFree and freetype2 are needed (see
  the FONT NAMES AND FONT LOADING section of the fvwm manual page).

* Conditional commands now have a return code (Match, NoMatch or
  Error).  This return code can be checked and tied to an action
  with the new commands Cond and CondCase.

* Bindings can be made to the separate parts of the window border
  with the new contexts '[', ']', '-', '_', '<', '^', '>' and 'v'.

* New parameters for FvwmRearange: -maximize and -animate.

* New option StartCommand for FvwmTaskBar to allow placing the
  StartMenu correctly.

    *FvwmTaskBar: StartCommand Popup RootMenu \
	rectangle $widthx$height+$left+$top 0 -100m

  Please refer to the FvwmTaskBar man page for details.

* New extended variables pointer.x, pointer.y, pointer.wx,
  pointer.wy, pointer.cx and pointer.cy.

* The Current command does not select a random window when no
  window has the focus.

* New colour '@4' (transparent) in button vectors.

* New option "Frame" for the Resize and ResizeMove commands.

* Added direction options to WindowShade command.  Windows can be
  shaded in any of the eight compass directions.

* Styles WindowShadeLazy (default), WindowShadeBusy and
  WindowShadeAlwaysLazy to optimize performance of the WindowShade
  command.

* The DO_START_ICONIC flag is no longer supported in the module
  interface.

* Added bi-directional text support for asian charsets.

* New option MinimalLayer for FvwmIdent to control window layer.

* New FvwmIconMan configuration syntax now conforms to the syntax of
  other modules, see the man page.

* FvwmForm can automatically run commands after a timeout interval.

* Fvwm commands can be invoked when the edge of the screen is hit
  with the mouse.

* New commands Colorset, ReadWriteColors and CleanupColorsets allow
  the colorset functionality previously available using FvwmTheme.

* FvwmTheme is obsolete now, but still supported for some time.

* New options Tint, TintMask and NoTint to colorsets.

* New WindowList option CurrentAtEnd.

* New weighted sorting in FvwmIconMan.
