Fvwm is a powerful window manager.  Version 2.5.24 is a beta
release that adds a couple of features and fixes a few bugs in
2.5.23. Please be aware that any features introduced in the 2.5.x
development versions may be renamed, changed or removed without
notice before 2.6.0.

Upgrading from 2.5.23 or earlier is recommended.

This release is available at the home page: http://www.fvwm.org/.

* New features:

   - Disabled paging during interactive resize operations by
     default (see 2.5.20) as it is annoying to many people.
   - New style command options:
       EdgeMoveResistance
       EdgeMoveDelay
       EdgeResizeDelay
       SnapGrid
       SnapAttraction
     that replace the now obsolete commands EdgeResistance,
     SnapGrid and SnapAttraction.  The EdgeResistance command has
     a new syntax with only one argument.
   - New command MenuCloseAndExec for menu bindinngs that can be
     used to trigger certain commands from a menu without an
     associated item.  For example, with
       Key F1 MTI[]-_ A MenuCloseAndExec Menu RootMenu
     the RootMenu can be opened from any other menu by pressing
     F1.

* Bug Fixes:

   - Sometimes a window jumped by half the screen's size when
     moving with the mouse and hitting the border of the desktop.
   - Fixed the "screen w" argument of the Move and other commands.
   - Clicking on a menu title did not close the menu by default.
   - Temporary files in FvwmPerl overwrote each other.
