Fvwm is a powerful window manager.  Version 2.5.4 is an
experimental unstable release that includes new features and
improvements over unstable 2.5.3 and stable 2.4.12 versions.  You
are welcome to upgrade and test the new features or help
stabilizing the code.  Please be aware that any features
introduced in the 2.5.x development versions may be renamed,

Fixed:
------

* Fixed flickering in menus, icon title, FvwmButtons, FvwmIconMan
  and FvwmPager when xft font is used.

* FvwmIconMan options PlainColorset, IconColorset, FocusColorset
  and SelectColorset are now strictly respected.

* See ChangeLog for more fixes.

New features:
-------------

* FvwmTaskBar may now include mini launchbuttons using the Button
  command.  Also has new options for spacing the buttons:
  WindowButtonsLeftMargin, WindowButtonsRightMargin, and
  StartButtonRightMargin.  See man page for details.

* Style switches can be prefixed with '!' to inverse their meaning.
  For example, "Style * Sticky" is the same as "Style * !Slippery".
  This works *only* for pairs of styles that take no arguments and
  for the Button and NoButton styles.

* New button property Id in FvwmButtons.  FvwmButtons now accepts
  dynamical actions using SendToModule, see the man page:

    ChangeButton <button-id> <properties-to-change>
    ExpandButtonVars <button-id> <command-to-expand>

* New Colorset options bgTint, fgTint (which complete Tint), Alpha,
  IconTint and IconAlpha.

* Alpha blending rendering is supported even without XRender
  support.

* FPClickToFocus and FPClickToRaise work with any modifier by
  default.

* Enhanced commands [Add]ButtonStyle, [Add]TitleStyle. ButtonState.
  Titles and buttons now have 4 main states instead of 3: ActiveUp,
  ActiveDown, InactiveUp and InactiveDown, plus 4 Toggled variants.
  Several shortcuts added: Active means ActiveUp + ActiveDown,
  Inactive means InactiveUp + InactiveDown, similarly for shortcuts
  ToggledActive and ToggledInactive.

* More shortcuts for button states added: AllNormal, AllToggled,
  AllActive, AllInactive, AllUp, AllDown.  These six shortcuts are
  actually different masks for 4 individual states (from 8 total).

* Perl library API regarding event handlers is changed, so personal
  modules in Perl should be adjusted.

* Allow the use of mouse buttons other than the first in
  FvwmWinList when invoked transient.

* ImagePath now supports directories in form "/some/directory;.png"
  (where semicolon delimits a file extension that files in
  /some/directory have.  This file extension replace the original
  image extension (if any) or it is added if an image has no one.

* New graphical debugger module FvwmGtkDebug.

* New command NoWindow for removing the window context.

* New FvwmIconMan option ShowTransient.

* All conditions have a negation.

* New FvwmBacker option RetainPixmap.

* FvwmButtons redrawing improvement: colorsets are now usable with
  containers.

* The HilightBack and ActiveFore menu styles are independent of
  each other.  HilightBack without using ActiveFore does no longer
  hilight the item text.

* New MenuStyle options HilightRelief and HilightReliefOff.
