FVWM 2.6.4
==========

* New features:
  
  - FvwmIconMan no longer allows for itself to be transient by using:

    Module FvwmIconMan Transient

    This is too ambiguous with valid module alias names, hence a
    transient FvwmIconMan must be created with "-Transient" as in:

    Module FvwmIconMan -Transient
  - New command InfoStore -- to store key/value pairs of information
    to relieve the burden of the SetEnv command.
  - Speed-up improvements for fvwm-menu-desktop when generating XDG
    menus by removing unnecessary stat(2) calls.
  - BusyCursor and CursorStyle have been set to make the cursor look
    like a dot during Read/PipeRead commands, by default.

* Bug fixes:

  - FvwmRearrange now understands the "ewmhiwa" option when placing
    windows.
  - Client gravity for subwindows is honoured for reparenting
    windows, such as with XEmbed, when changing the parent's
    geometry.
  - Conditional command processing of !Layer n, as in:
    
        Next (Xteddy, !Layer 4) Echo cuddles
    
    has now been fixed.
  - Fixed handling of swallowed windows for transient FvwmButtons'.
  - fvwm-menu-desktop now looks in /usr/share/applications for KDE
    legacy mode.
  - fvwm-config no longer accepts "--is-stable", "--is-released",
	"--is-final".
