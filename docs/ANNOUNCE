Available at http://www.fvwm.org/ it includes the following

Highlights:

 ** A new "Themes" module and "colorsets" including 6 kinds of gradients
    and pixmap support controlling the appearance of borders, titlebars,
    frames, menus, and modules.

 ** Gnome compliance, ICCCM2 compliance.

 ** Optional session management.

 ** FvwmAnimate support in FvwmIconBox, FvwmIconMan, FvwmTaskBar, and
    FvwmWinList.

 ** Stroke support.

 ** Titlebars at the top or bottom of windows.

 ** The root cursor now indicates when Fvwm is busy.

 ** New command to configure a way to abort Fvwm.

 ** Menus on the fly and some menu generating scripts.

 ** Much more flexibility and control in menu definition.

 ** Starting Fvwm without a config file now really works.

 ** For many users, the ModulePath and ImagePath commands will become
    unnecessary.  Both can be built in.  User specified ModulePath and
    ImagePath can add on to the built in paths.

 ** Key and mouse bindings and style commands take effect immediately,
    recapture is no longer needed to make most changes.

 ** Most users can remove the Colorlimit command.  It takes the best
    setting depending on the color depth.

 ** Control over mouse pointer colors and pixmap pointers.

 ** New module FvwmGtk.

 ** VMS port.

 ** Animated window shading.

 ** Layers.
