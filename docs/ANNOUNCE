The FVWM-Workers list is pleased to announce FVWM version 2.4 "F2K"
%% domivogt: Ha ha ha 8-). "F2K" reminds me a bit of "F**k"
%% domivogt: how about "Fvwm 3000 - The window manager of the next millenium"
%% domivogt: ;-)

Available at http://www.fvwm.org/ it includes the following

Highlights:

 ** A new "Themes" module called FvwmTheme and "colorsets" including
    8 kinds of gradients and pixmap support controlling the appearance
    of borders, titlebars, frames, menus and modules.

 ** Gnome compliance as a compile time option.

 ** ICCCM2 compliance.

 ** Optional session management.

 ** FvwmAnimate support in FvwmIconBox, FvwmIconMan, FvwmTaskBar, and
    FvwmWinList.

 ** Mouse stroke support.
%% domivogt: add a pointer to libstroke here?

 ** Titlebars at the bottom or the top of windows with the
    TitleAtBottom and TitleAtTop styles.

 ** The root cursor now indicates when Fvwm is busy.

 ** New command to configure a way to abort Fvwm.
%% domivogt: What does this mean? Which command?

 ** Menus on the fly and some menu generating scripts.
%% What are 'Menus on the fly'? Do I get these if I use fvwm on a laptop
   when traveling with a plane?

 ** Much more flexibility and control in menu definition.

 ** Starting Fvwm without a config file now really works.

 ** For many users, the ModulePath and ImagePath commands will become
    unnecessary.  Both can be built in.  User specified ModulePath and
    ImagePath can add on to the built in paths.

 ** Key and mouse bindings and style commands take effect immediately,
    recapture is no longer needed to make most changes.

 ** Most users can remove the ColorLimit command.  It takes the best
    setting depending on the color depth.

 ** Control over mouse pointer colors and pixmap pointers.

 ** New module FvwmGtk for Gtk style menus.

 ** VMS port.
%% domivogt: we should definitely try it out first!

 ** Animated window shading with the WindowShadeAnimate command.

 ** Layers.
%% domivogt: we need an introduction about layers somewhere

 ** The WindowList command has more option to allow better
    control of which windows are shown.
