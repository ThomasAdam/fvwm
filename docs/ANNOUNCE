Fvwm 2.4.5 is a bug fix release for version 2.4.4.  It addresses a
number of less important problems.  If you encountered none of the
problems you can safely continue using 2.4.4.

The release is available at the fvwm home page: http://www.fvwm.org/


New features:
-------------

* New style BackingStoreWindowDefault which is the default
  now. Fvwm no longer disables backing store on windows by
  default. This may help with some applications that do not redraw
  properly.
