fvwm-2.4.20 maintenance release for all earlier 2.4.x versions.
It contains a number of minor fixes and one important security fix.

This release is available at the home page: http://www.fvwm.org/.

Who needs to upgrade?
---------------------

Because of the security issues with fvwm-2.3.4 to fvwm-2.4.19, it
is strongly recommended to upgrade to fvwm-2.4.19.

System administrators are encouraged to install this version to
grant their users access to the latest stable version.

Bug Fixes:
----------

* The configure script now correctly appends executable file
  extensions to conditionally built binaries. Fixes building on
  Cygwin.

* FvwmConsole no longer conflicts with getline of Cygwin's stdio.

* Fixed parsing of For loops in FvwmScript.

* Fixed a possible endless loop when de-iconifying a transient
  window.

* Reject some invalid GNOME hints.

* Fixed a loop when xterm changes its "active icon" size.

* The configure script can now cope with four-part version numbers
  when detecting some libraries.

* Security fixes in

     fvwm-menu-directory. (CVE-2006-5969)
     FvwmCommand
