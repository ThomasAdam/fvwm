-------------------------------------------------------------------

fvwm-2.4.16 maintenance release for all earlier 2.4.x versions.
It contains many small fixes in fvwm and some of the modules.

This release is available at the home page: http://www.fvwm.org/.
We are 10 year old now, participate in the birthday events!

Who needs to upgrade?
---------------------

Everyone who needs a support or experiences a problem with earlier
2.4.x versions.  Like the previous versions, this one includes
some synchronization syntax enhancements with 2.5.x versions that
will be suggested on the support mailing lists, so the sooner
users upgrade the sooner they could use the suggested solutions.
System administrators are encouraged to install this version to
grant their users an access to the latest stable version.

Bug Fixes:
----------

* Fixed a transparency problem in FvwmButtons.

* Fixed a possible core dump when more than 256 windows are on
  the desktop.

* Initial drawing and final undrawing of wire frame no longer
  toggles the pixel in the top left corner of the screen.

* Fixed parsing of button geometries in FvwmButtons when the
  geometry specificaiton appeared after another option with a comma
  at the end.

* FvwmCommand works too when invoked without the DISPLAY variable
  set.

* Fixed displaying iconified windows without an icon in
  FvwmIconMan.

* Fixed a bug with aspect pixmaps in colorsets.

* Fixed a bug in FvwmPager that displayed iconified windows without
  icon title or picture as not iconified.

* Fixed parsing of '@<screen>' Xinerama specification in the
  ButtonGeometry option of FvwmButtons.

* Fixed a problem with styles not being properly applied after a
  DestroyStyle command.

* Fixed a bug introduced in 2.4.14.  The pointer was sometimes
  warped to another screen during a restart and command execution.

* Fixed a crash when a window was destroyed twice in a complex
  function.

* Fixed corruption of the window list when windows died at the
  wrong time.

* Fixed problem with empty frame windows if X recycled the window
  id of a window that died recently.

* Fixed loading of application supplied pixmap on 8/24 depth screen.

* Fixed "GotoDeskAndPage prev" on desks larger than 2x2.

* Expansion of variables like $[w.name] or $[EMPTY_STRING] that are
  empty works.

* The PageOnly option in FvwmTaskBar now works after a desk change
  too.

* Iconified windows without an icon do not receive focus.

Improvements:
-------------

* All single letter variables are deprecated now; new variables:

    $[w.id], $[w.name], $[w.iconname], $[w.class], $[w.resource],
    $[desk.n], $[version.num], $[version.info], $[version.line],
    $[desk.pagesx], $[desk.pagesy]

* The NoWarp menu position hint option works with root menus too.

* WindowListFunc is executed now within a window context, so
  a prefix "WindowId $0" is not needed in its definition anymore
  and it is advised to remove it in user configs.

* FvwmEvent now executes all window related events within a window
  context, so PassId is not needed anymore, and all prefixes
  "WindowId $0" may be removed in user event handlers.
