FVWM 2.6.3
==========

* New features:

  - New Style commands:

        TitleFormat
        IconTitleFormat

        Used to specify a window's visible name.  These new options
        deprecate the older styles:

        IndexedWindowName
        IndexedIconName
        ExactWindowName
        ExactIconName

  - New Resize argument to direction:  "automatic" which works out,
    automatically, which direction a window should be resized in
    based on which quadrant the pointer is in on the window -- this
    is best observed by the grid formed from "ResizeOutline", as the
    shape of this grid is used when calculating this.

    Furthermore, the existing option of "warptoborder" can be used in
    conjunction with "direction automatic" to warp the pointer to the
    appropriate window edge.

  - Couple of changes to the Move command:
        - The EWMH working area is now honoured by default.
        - To move a window ignoring the working area, the option
          "ewmhiwa" can be used, similar to how the Maximize
          command works.

  - New expansion placeholder $[pointer.screen] to return the screen number
    the pointer is on.

* Bug fixes:

    - A few minor ones; nothing user-visible per se.
