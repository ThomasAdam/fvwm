Fvwm is a powerful window manager.  Version 2.5.14 is a beta
release that fixes a couple of bugs, including some crashes.  You
are welcome to upgrade and test the new features or help
stabilizing the code.  Please be aware that any features
introduced in the 2.5.x development versions may be renamed,
changed or removed without notice before 2.6.0.

2.5.14 is the first release that includes official (but
experimental) support for 64-bit architectures, including AMD64
support. For 64-bit support, upgrading from any earlier release is
mandatory. Otherwise upgrading from any earlier 2.5.x release is
recommended.

This release is available at the home page: http://www.fvwm.org/.

* New features:

   - Fvwm now officially supports 64-bit architertures.
   - New Test conditions EnvIsSet, EnvMatch, EdgeHasPointer and
     EdgeIsActive.
   - New window condition FixedPosition.

* New module features:

   - FvwmPerl module supports window context when preprocessing.
   - FvwmPerl module accepts new --export option that by default
     defines two fvwm functions "Eval" and ".", to be used like:

       FvwmPerl -x
       Eval $a = $[desk.n] - 2; cmd("GotoDesk 0 $a") if $a >= 0
       . Exec xmessage %{2 + cos(0)}%    # embedded calculator

   - Fixed a Solaris compiler error introduced in 2.5.13.
   - Fixed a hang with layers set by applications (e.g. AbiWord).
   - GotoDesk with a relative page argument now wraps around at
     the end of the given range as documented. (Bug #1396).
   - PopupDelayed menu style option was not copied on
     CopyMenuStyle.
   - Transparent Animated menus with non-transparent popup were
     not animated correctly.
   - Supported euc-jp class of encodings.
   - A window's default layer is no longer set to 0 durin a
     restart.
   - Fixed an annoying MouseFocus/SloppyFocus problem in

     problem first occured in 2.5.11.
