FVWM 2.6.2
==========

* New features:

  - New MenuStyle "UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate" and its
    negation "!UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate" to retain the menu
    until the user presses one of the menu keybindings to enact
    that change in the case where there's only one item defined in
    the menu at the specified hotkey.

* Bug fixes:

  - Fix infinite loop crash when FvwmButtons quits/restarts with
    RootTransparent colorsets.
  - Fix setting window states across FVWM restarts where those
    windows do not set WM_COMMAND.
  - Windows are now correctly restored when coming out of
    fullscreen mode.
