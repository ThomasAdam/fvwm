Please keep in mind that the Beta code can potentially become
unstable or buggy at any time, so USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
Of course you may find bugs in "Official" versions also.
If you do download a Beta version, we do appreciate bug reports.
Send bug reports to the
<a href="mailto:fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu">FVWM Workers Mailing List</a>.

If you just have a question, be sure to first read our
<a href="docs.html">Documentation</a> first, then you might want to
try our <a href="mailinglist.html">Mailing List</a>.
<p>
I know you have heard this a million times...always
tell us what release of fvwm you are running, your operating system,
and other pertinent information.
<p>
Development right now (11/98) is quite active, expect to see a new
release "Real Soon Now".
