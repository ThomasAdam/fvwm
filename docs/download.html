Please keep in mind that the Beta code can potentially become
unstable or buggy at any time, so USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
Of course you may find bugs in "Official" versions also.

<p>
If you find any bugs, you can enter them into the
<a href="http://www.fvwm.org/cgi-bin/fvwm-bug">FVWM Bug Tracking System</a>.

reported this bug.  If you have more or better information, feel
free to add a note!

<p>
If you just have a question, be sure to read our
<a href="docs.html">Documentation</a> first, then you might want to

When asking for help, of course always remember to provide the release
number of fvwm, your operating system, and any other information you
think might be pertinent.
