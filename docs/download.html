<p>
Older versions of FVWM2 can be found <a
href="ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/version-2/">here</a>.

<p>
Daily snapshots are available <a
href="ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/snapshots/">here</a>.  Note that
these may not work; they might not even build.  Use them at your own risk.

<p>
A complete copy of the current CVS sources are <a
href="ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/sources/">here</a>.  This directory
is updated every three hours.  It is simpler to use CVS than to fetch these
files, but if you are behind a restrictive firewall or don't need CVS
features like easy patch generation or commits then you can use an FTP
mirroring tool to grab this directory.  Since this is an exact copy of what
you'd get if you did a CVS checkout, you should read up on <a
href="cvs.html">CVS</a>.

<p>
Very old releases of FVWM version 1 can be found <a
href="ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/version-1/">here</a>.

<p>
