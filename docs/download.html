<h2>
What package should you use?</h2>
Note that since the days of 2.1.x the second digit of the version number
marks a release as a stable release (even number like 2.2.x) or as a development
(i.e. alpha or beta) release (odd number like 2.3.4).
<p><i>Stable release:</i>
<p>Use it if you have no specific reason to use one of the other packages.
Questions about the stable releases should be asked on our <a href="mailinglist.html">Mailing
List</a>.
<p>*** If you use anything else but the latest stable release we will make
no promises that anything works. ***
<p><i>Older 2.x and 1.x versions:</i>
<p>Don't use them. If you encounter we will most likely ask you to upgrade.
There is a constant stream of bug fixes and we cannot spend our time fixing
the same bugs again and again.
<p>*** Problems in one of the below packages should be discussed on the
fvwm-workers <a href="mailinglist.html">Mailing List</a>. ***
<p><i>Latest Alpha and Beta versions:</i>
<p>Use them if you can tolerate some bugs and really need one of the new
features.
<p><i>Daily snapshots:</i>
<p>If you want the development stuff but don't want to set up the build
environment. Note that the snapshots may not even compile. Use them at
your own risk.
<p><i>CVS access:</i>
<p>When you must have the latest stuff, up to the minute, or want to contribute
heavily. Please read the <a href="cvs.html">CVS</a><i>&nbsp;</i> instructions.
<p><i>FTP source tree:</i>
<p>If you want to use CVS but can't. This directory is updated every three
hours. It is simpler to use CVS than to fetch these files, but if you are
behind a restrictive firewall or don't need CVS features like easy patch
generation or commits then you can use an FTP mirroring tool to grab this
directory. Since this is an exact copy of what you'd get if you did a CVS
checkout, you should read up on <a href="cvs.html">CVS</a>.
