<P>
Limited effort has been placed on security issues. In short, modules
can not communicate with Fvwm unless they are launched by Fvwm, which
means that they must be listed in the user's .fvwmrc file.
Modules can only issue commands to Fvwm that could be issued from a
menu or key binding. These measures do not keep a poorly written
module from destroying windows or terminating an X session, but they
do keep users from maliciously connecting to another users window
manager, and it should keep modules from corrupting the Fvwm internal 
databases.
