        1) What does FVWM stand for?
        2) Where do I find the current versions of fvwm?
        3) Any WWW Sites about FVWM?
        4) Where do I ask questions about FVWM?
        5) What are the differences between FVWM 1.xx and 2.xx?
        6) My .fvwmrc from version 1.xx no longer works.  What do I do?
        7) I have a window that is behaving unexpectedly under FVWM, but just
           fine under (whatever other window manager), or I have just some
           random bug.  What do I do?
        8) What's the relative memory usage for the various window managers
           out there?
        9) I used to use GoodStuff in FVWM 1.xx, but it's not in the 2.xx
           distribution.  What do I use now?
       10) I'm using FvwmButtons (or GoodStuff in 1.xx), and sometimes the
           buttons stay depressed, and other times they don't.  Why is that?
       11) What happened to the FVWM 1.xx 'include' command?
       12) I really like the horizontal bars that appear on the title bars of
           sticky windows.  Can I get those on other windows as well?
       13) I'm trying to build FVWM, but the linker is complaining
           about missing functions like 'XpmReadFileToPixmap' or not
           being able to find libXpm or the compiler can't find the
           include file X11/xpm.h.  Why is that?
       14) I'm trying to compile FVWM under SunOS using cc, but the compiler
           is having lots of problems.  What gives?

       15) (Question gone)

       16) I'd really like to see neat feature XYZ in FVWM.
           Wouldn't that be cool?  I even have a patch.  When can it
           be added?
       17) I know this question doesn't have to do with FVWM, but what
           happened to to rxvt and rclock which Rob Nation used to
           support?  Where can I find them now?
       18) Where can I get more XPMs for icons?
       19) How do I set the Sun keyboard key xxxx to an FVWM command?
           Or more generally, I'm having problems defining key
           bindings for FVWM - what can I do?
       20) I clicked on a program's Motif menubar and the menu pops up
           then dissappears.  What gives?
       21) I heard about this FvwmFileMgr module.  Where can I find it?
       22) I'd really like {NeXT, Win95, etc} look and feel.  Are you
           going to support that?

       23) (Question gone)

       24) How do I create/submit/apply patches?
       25) I'd like to bind a key to paste/use the current selection,
           how can I do that?
       26) You can bind mouse movements to keystrokes, how about mouse
           presses?
       27) What exactly is the differenct between a DESK, a PAGE, and
           the SCREEN?
       28) Why the rename of the various files (fvwm2, .fvwm2rc,
           fvwm2.man)?
       29) Every time I update my install, my currently running fvwm
           session dies.  Why is that?
       30) Will FVWM ever support a separate colormap for each desktop?
       31) I try to run some program under FVWM, but it dies with an
           X11 error like BadAccess.  The same program works just fine
           under MWM or OLWM.  What's going on?
       32) I'm want to use FVWM, but I don't have root access on my
           machine.  Can I still install and run it?

       33) (Question gone)

       34) When will fvwm release X.Y.Z be ready?
       35) I'm a sysadmin, and if I wanted to force fvwm to read a
           system rc file and then the user's rc file, how would I do
           that?
       36) I'm a sysadmin, and if I wanted fvwm to look for all of
           it's rc files in a hidden directory, say ~/.fvwm, much like
           CDE does, how could I do that?

       37) (question gone)

       38) When having FvwmButtons swallow an app, is it possible to
           have button presses assigned to actions as well?  For
           instance, I'd like to swallow xload and have a button press
           pop up an xterm, or swallow xbiff and have a button press
           bring up the list of messages.
       39) I'm trying to use fvwm under CDE/COSE, but encountering
           difficulties.  Any suggestions?
       40) How do I capture the output (eg errors) of fvwm?
       41) Linux XF86 virtual screen size & fvwm interaction...
       42) Why do NumLock and CapsLock interfere with ClickToFocus
           and/or my mouse bindings?
       43) I'm seeing odd things when trying to preprocess files with
           the FvwmM4/Cpp module...

       44) (question gone)

       45) Is it possible to raise a window when I click into the
           window itself, not just the border?
       46) Menus with gradient backgrounds flicker or are very slow.
       47) How do I get Alt-Tab behaviour like another GUI?
       48) What's the difference between the Focus and FlipFocus commands?
       49) Why won't the StartIconic style work with {Netscape, etc.}?

======================================================================


1) What does FVWM stand for?

A: "Fill_in_the_blank_with_whatever_f_word_you_like_at_the_time
   Virtual Window Manager".  Rob Nation (the original Author of FVWM)
   doesn't really remember what the F stood for origninally, so we
   have several potential answers:

     Feeble, Fabulous, Famous, Fast, Foobar, Fantastic, Flexible,
     F!@#$%, Flashy, FVWM (the GNU recursive approach), Free, Final,
     Funky, Fred's (who the heck is Fred?), Freakin', Flawed,
     Father-of-all, Feivel (the mouse from "An American Tail"), etc.

   Just pick your favorite (hey, there's another one!), which will of
   course change depending on your mood and whether or not you've run
   across any bugs recently.  I prefer Fabulous or Fantastic myself,
   although I often use F!@#$% or Freakin' while debugging...

   Recently 'Feline' is becoming popular. Perhaps this has something
   to do with the discovery that four of the six core developers have
   cats (averaging 1.17 cats)? Miaow.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Where do I find the current versions of fvwm?

A: New main distribution site (official + beta code):

                ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm

   Alternate sites:

            USA:
                ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/window-managers/
                ftp://ftp.cs.columbia.edu/pub/cheah/

            Europe:
                ftp://unix.hensa.ac.uk/pub/walnut.creek/FreeBSD/incoming/
                ftp://ftp.jussieu.fr/pub/X11/fvwm/
                ftp://ftp.loria.fr/pub/unix/fvwm/

   BTW, 1.24r was the last released version of the 1.xx series and the
   first official release of 2.xx will be 2.2. After that an odd second
   digit denote development releases and even numbers denote officially
   stable releases.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Any WWW Sites about FVWM?

A: Yup.  The official site is currently:

        http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/fvwm/

   There are links on the official site to other related fvwm sites.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Where do I ask questions about FVWM?

A: If your local FVWM maintainer can't help you, then the newsgroup
   comp.windows.x.apps is a good place, but the fvwm mailing list is
   usually better.  The new FVWM discussion mailing list address is:

                           fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

   And there is an announce mailing list as well:

                       fvwm-announce@hpc.uh.edu

   They are maintained by Jason Tibbitts, and are Majordomo based
   mailing lists.  To subscribe to the list, send "subscribe fvwm" in
   the body of a message to majordomo@hpc.uh.edu.  To unsubscribe from
   the list, send "unsubscribe fvwm" in the body of a message to
   majordomo@hpc.uh.edu.  To report problems, send mail to
   fvwm-owner@hpc.uh.edu.

   Here's the list descriptions and instructions directly from Jason:

   =================================================================
   (fvwm)

   Description
   -----------

   This list is for discussion relating to the FVWM window manager,
   which is intended to have a small memory footprint and a rich
   feature set, be extremely customizable and extendable and have a
   high degree of Motif mwm compatibility.  All relevant discussion is
   encouraged.  Posting of binaries or irrelevant discussion is
   strongly frowned upon.  Posting of short patches (less than 200
   lines) is acceptable, but all patches should be sent to the FVWM
   maintainer for inspection and possible inclusion in the
   distribution.  The current maintainer is:

   the fvwm-workers list.  See our web page for instructions.


   Instructions
   ------------

   To send a message to the list, mail to fvwm@hpc.uh.edu.  For help
   on dealing with the mailing list software (for getting the archives
   or other files which may be made available) send the message "help"
   to majordomo@hpc.uh.edu.  If you have problems with the mailing
   list itself and need to talk to a human, send mail to
   fvwm-owner@hpc.uh.edu.  This address is for mailing list issues
   only; reports on the FVWM software will be sent to /dev/null.

   Archives of previous messages are available; to get them send the
   above mentioned help message and investigate the "index" and "get"
   commands or ftp them from ftp.hpc.uh.edu in /pub/fvwm/list-archive.


   (fvwm-announce)

   This list is for announcements relating to the FVWM window manager,
   which is intended to have a small memory footprint and a rich
   feature set, be extremely customizable and extendable and have a
   high degree of Motif mwm compatibility.

   Replies to messages from this list are set by default to go the
   FVWM discussion list, fvwm@hpc.uh.edu.

   The current FVWM distribution is available for ftp at
   ftp.hpc.uh.edu in /pub/fvwm.

5) What are the differences between FVWM 1.xx and 2.xx?

A: A lot.  To name a few general ones:
        - Bugfixes.  1.xx is not worked on at all any more.
        - Better rc file format.  No longer order dependent.
        - More flexible and powerful.  For example, many previously
          global options now operate on a per window group level
          instead.
        - More and better modules.
        - OpaqueResize is gone (fear not, it may come back).
        - M4 preprocessing is no longer part of the fvwm exec, but
          rather has been moved to a module.  There is also a module
          to use cpp too.  See the FvwmM4 and FvwmCpp man pages.

   Be sure to check the NEWS file for new or changed features too.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

6) My .fvwmrc from version 1.xx no longer works.  What do I do?

A: Start with a new one or convert your old one.  This can be done by
   hand or with a little help from the 'fvwmrc_convert' in the
   utils directory.

   And here is a list of rc file command changes compiled by Makoto
   'MAR_kun' MATSUSHITA <matusita@ics.es.osaka-u.ac.jp>.  It may or
   may not be 100% accurate or complete, especially as changes evolve,
   but it's a good start.

   Note that there have been some changes in 2.1.x and up that are
   not reflected in the conversion script yet.

7) I have a window that is behaving unexpectedly under FVWM, but just
   fine under (whatever other window manager), or I have just some
   random bug.  What do I do?

A: First, check your rc file and your .Xdefaults to make sure that
   something blatantly obvious in there isn't causing the problem,
   plus *PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE* check the FAQ, BUGS, TODO, and man
   pages (i.e. RTFM).  Perhaps even the official WWW page and the
   mailing list archives (which have a search facility) stored there.

   If you still can't figure it out, send a DETAILED description of
   the problem to the FVWM mailing list.  By detailed I mean more than
   just "my window isn't behaving right" or "I found a bug":

        - Describe the problem as best you can, preferrably with
          suggestions on how to reproduce it easily
        - If applicable, include information from:
                xwininfo (preferably w/ the -all option)
                xprop
                FvwmIdent
                xdpyinfo (maybe)
        - What OS & version you are running under
        - What version of X11 are you running under, and is it an MIT
          server or a vendor specific server (ex the OpenWindow X
          server under SunOS)
        - What exact version of FVWM you are running.
        - How was FVWM compiled (compiler & version, options, etc)
        - What settings to you have in your .fvwm2rc that may be
          pertinent

----------------------------------------------------------------------

8) What's the relative memory usage for the various window managers
   out there?

A: Here's a little table comparing some of them.  It was done on an
   AIX based IBM RS6000 model 355 using the same number of windows (3)
   and XSession to switch between the window managers, and I used
   'top' to show the values:

      SIZE   RES
      545K  652K fvwm2 (fvwm 2.0.35)
      457K  528K fvwm  (fvwm 1.24rb)
      856K  960K ctwm  (ctwm 3.2p1)
     1004K 1156K mwm   (mwm 1.2)
      543K  632K twm   (???)
      263K  328K aixwm (a simple ugly window manager included w/ aix)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

9) I used to use GoodStuff in FVWM 1.xx, but it's not in the 2.xx
   distribution.  What do I use now?

A: GoodStuff was renamed to FvwmButtons.  Same module, new name (that
   fits in with the other modules naming convention).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

10) I'm using FvwmButtons (or GoodStuff in 1.xx), and sometimes the
    buttons stay depressed, and other times they don't.  Why is that?

A: From the FvwmButtons man page:

       If command is an fvwm Exec command, then the button
       will remain pushed in until a window whose name or
       class matches the qouted portion of the command is
       encountered. This is intended to provide visual
       feedback to the user that the action he has requested
       will be performed. If the qouted portion contains no
       characters, then the button will pop out immediately.
       Note that users can continue pressing the button, and
       re-executing the command, even when it looks "pressed
       in."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

11) What happened to the FVWM 1.xx 'include' command?

A: It was actually part of the M4 preprocessing (see above).  You can
   use the 'Read' builtin to get the same effect, or use the M4
   module.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

12) I really like the horizontal bars that appear on the title bars of
    sticky windows.  Can I get those on other windows as well?

A: Yes. Put the line "GlobalOpts StipledTitles" in your .fvwm2rc.
   Note that this is a purposely undocumented feature since it
   will eventually be made a Style option.  If you use this,
   it is guaranteed to stop working some day.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

13) I'm trying to build FVWM, but the linker is complaining about
    missing functions like 'XpmReadFileToPixmap' or not being able to
    find libXpm or the compiler can't find the include file X11/xpm.h.
    Why is that?

A: You need to have the Xpm (X Pixmap) library on your system.  You
   can find the source for it at ftp.x.org in /contrib/libraries (or
   at its home page http://www.inria.fr/koala/lehors/xpm.html) to
   compile and install it by hand, or you can find some "standard"
   distribution for your particular flavor of OS and install that.  Or
   you can compile fvwm without Xpm support (try ./configure --help)
   and lose out on all the pretty color icons.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

14) I'm trying to compile FVWM under SunOS using cc, but the compiler
    is having lots of problems.  What gives?

A: cc under SunOS is not an ANSI C compiler.  Try using acc or gcc
   instead.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

16) I'd really like to see neat feature XYZ in FVWM.  Wouldn't
    that be cool?  I even have a patch.  When can it be added?

A: People are always requesting or suggestion new features (many of
   which are great ideas and where a lot of the current features came
   from).  One of the more common ones for example is Windows 95 look
   and feel (although since this was first written, that particular
   feature has actually been indirectly implemented via several
   appearance effecting features).

   I'd like to make a statement about this.  FVWM is supposed to be
   small, fast, powerful, and flexible, and sometimes tradeoffs have
   to be made here.  The module interface helps here, as a lot of
   features that not everyone wants or needs don't have to be in the
   main module consuming resources for those people that don't want or
   need them.

   So if you have a suggestion (or a patch), please think of a way to
   make it as small and generic as possible if you feel it belongs in
   the main module.  Also, take a look in the TODO list and see if it
   isn't already in there.

   Bear in mind that we make no guarantees that we'll add any requested
   feature or apply any submitted patches to the official version, but
   please don't let this dissuade you from submitting them.  We like to
   get new ideas and we're always curious to see how someone would
   implement a given feature, even if we never plan to put it in fvwm.
   Also, we may choose to reimplement any patches submitted, which may
   change the syntax, functionality, etc.  Please don't take offense
   from that, as we mean no offense and we generally have a good reason
   (at least by our way of thinking) for our actions...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

17) I know this question doesn't have to do with FVWM, but what
    happened to to rxvt and rclock which Rob Nation used to support?
    Where can I find them now?

A: This has come up a few times, so I thought I'd put it here too.
   I believe that the new official home for rxvt is:

               http://babayaga.math.fu-berlin.de/~rxvt/

   and rclock can be found in that rxvt distribution as well.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

18) Where can I get more XPMs for icons?

A: If you want more color icons, grab the ones out of the ctwm
   distribution (also at ftp.x.org) which has a lot of nice ones.  You
   can also find more in other distributions at ftp.x.org, and at
   http://www.sct.gu.edu.au/~anthony/icons/ (which has a lot, I
   believe).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

19) How do I set the Sun keyboard key xxxx to an FVWM command?  Or
    more generally, I'm having problems defining key bindings for FVWM
    - what can I do?

A: From Jon Mountjoy, one of FVWM's users:
     - Function keys on Sun Keyboard on Top Row are F1 - F8
     - Keys on the function keypad on the Left of the Sun Keyboard
       are F11 == Stop, F12 == Again, ..., F20 == Cut

     His Example:

     # Function keys on Sun Keyboard on Top Row
     Key F1     A     N       Exec me(netscape) &
     Key F2     A     N       Exec me(netscape -install) &
     Key F5     A     N       Exec makex(Adder)
     Key F6     A     N       Exec makex(Lambda)
     Key F7     A     N       Exec makex(Castor)
     Key F8     A     N       Exec xterm -T Local &

     # Keys on the function keypad on the Left of the Sun Keyboard:
     # F11 = Stop, F12 = Again, ..., F20 = Cut
     Key F11    AWF   N       Next [!iconic CurrentScreen CurrentDesk] Focus
     Key F12    AWF   N       Prev [!iconic CurrentScreen CurrentDesk] Focus
     Key F13    WF    N       Maximize     100 100
     Key F15    WF    N       RaiseLower ""
     Key F17    WIF   N       Iconify ""
     Key F18    WF    N       Stick ""
     Key F20    WIF   N       Delete ""
     Key Help   AWF   N       Iconify ""

   A more general solution is to use xev (usually distributed w/ X11)
   or xkeykaps (an X11 interface to xmodmap written by Jamie Zawinski,
   available from ftp.x.org) to find out what the keysym for whatever
   key you want REALLY is, and use that for binding fvwm commands.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

20) I clicked on a program's Motif menubar (with click to focus or
    stays on top set) and the menu pops up then dissappears.  What
    gives?

A: Known problem.  The window is being raised over the
   override_redirect window that is being used to display the menu.
   Be sure the window is raised before you click on the menubar.  I
   don't know if there is really anything I can do to help this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

21) I heard about this FvwmFileMgr module.  Where can I find it?

A: The FvwmFileMgr module dissappeared because a file manager doesn't
   need to be integrated with a window manager and something like xfm
   does a much better job.  I recommend you pick that up instead (from
   ftp.x.org or your favorite mirror).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

22) I'd really like {OpenWindows, NeXT, Win95, Mac, etc} look and
    feel.  Are you going to support that?

A: This is not our primary mission, but we think fvwm2 does a pretty
   good job of producing these appearances.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

24) How do I create/submit/apply patches?

A: Creating a patch -

        1) Update the ChangeLog file. If you use (x)emacs, move the
           cursor into the function you changed and hit <ctrl>-4 a.
           This will generate an empty ChangeLog entry in the right
           file (there are several ChangeLogs). Add a description of
           what you did. Repeat this for all changed functions or
           files (for changes outside of funtions). You should update
           the AUTHORS and NEWS files too if appropriate.
           Please take the time to add the ChangeLog entries, it makes
           our work a lot easier.
        2) Copy the originial file(s) to the same name with the
           additional extension of .orig (or something like that).
           Don't forget the ChangeLog.
        3) Then run diff with either the -c (context) or -u (unified)
           switch on the sets of files, with the .orig file FIRST.  I
           prefer unifified diff's because they are smaller, but
           sometimes they aren't as readable (and some diff versions
           don't support unified diffs), so either context or unified
           diffs are fine (but please, no "plain" diffs).

        ex: cp fvwm.c fvwm.c.orig ; <edit> ; diff -u fvwm.c.orig fvwm.c

   Submitting a patch -

        Just mail it to the fvwm or fvwm-workers mailing list, is the
        best way I guess. If your patch is large you should compress
        it (preferrably with gzip). Should it still be larger than
        25k you might want to to place it on a web page and email thei
        URL to the mailing list or ask on the fvwm-workers list first.
        Oh, and be sure to read the last paragraph of #16 above...

   Applying a patch -

        Get a copy of the program 'patch' from your favorite source,
        such as prep.ai.mit.edu in /pub/gnu, compile it, and then
        follow it's directions (generally just cd into the appropriate
        directory and run 'patch < patchfile').

----------------------------------------------------------------------

25) I'd like to bind a key to paste/use the current selection, how can
    I do that?

A: You can't directly with fvwm, but there may be a solution that is
   more generally applicable - use the program 'xcb' available at
   ftp.x.org in /contrib/utilities or from your favorite mirror.  It
   could probably be used to get the desired effect or close to it.
   This is most useful for running programs and passing the selection
   to them (eg - invoke your favorite browser with the current
   selection as the URL).  To get a semi-generic paste facility to
   work, you'll probably need to use 'xse' (see #26 below).  If anyone
   comes up with a good example of this, please send it to the fvwm
   mailing list for inclusion here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

26) You can bind mouse movements to keystrokes, how about mouse
    presses?

A: Hm.  This one is a little tougher.  It could be done, but many
   programs ignore synthetic events, which is what would be generated.
   In X11R6.1 there is an extension (called XKBD?) which can do this,
   but I don't want to code to anything specific to one of the newer
   X11 versions like this.  You could try using Xse, which is a
   program to interface to XSendEvent, available at ftp.x.org.  It
   could probably be used in a smiliar manner to xcb above (or in
   conjunction with it).  If anyone comes up with good examples for
   this, please send it to the fvwm mailing list for inclusion here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

27) What exactly is the differenct between a DESK, a PAGE, and the
    SCREEN?

A: Our naming convention is sometimes a source of confusion, and when
   discussing problems and the like it's good to maintain a consistent
   meaning.  To illustrate how features of fvwm should be referred to
   - fvwm has multiple disjoint DESKTOPS, each of which is comprised
   of M by N PAGES, which are each the size of the physical SCREEN.
   The physical SCREEN acts as a viewport over one of the PAGES of the
   current DESK.  Here's a picture to clarify (also, take a look at
   the FvwmPager module):

             Desk 0                     Desk 1
     +----------+----------+    +----------+----------+
     |          |          |    |          |          |
     | Page 0 0 | Page 1 0 |    |          |          |
     |          |          |    |          |          |
     |          |          |    |          |          |
     +----------+----------+    +----------+----------+
     |+--------+|          |    |          |          |
     ||Page 0 1|| Page 1 1 |    |          |          |
     ||        ||          |    |          |          |
     |+--------+|          |    |          |          |
     +----------+----------+    +----------+----------+

   It shows two 2 x 2 DESKTOPS.  If the current DESK were number 0,
   and the current PAGE were 0 1, the SCREEN would show only the
   windows located there, plus any sticky ones.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

28) Why the rename of the various files (fvwm2, .fvwm2rc, fvwm2.man)?

A: Some people find this annoying, but let me say that I did that for
   several reasons:

        - so both 1.xx and 2.xx can be installed for use, in case some
          people at the same site would rather stay at 1.xx
        - fvwm2 coredumps usually if it tries to read in a 1.xx rc
          file because the syntax is pretty different and completely
          incompatable
        - when people ask questions, if they explicitly mention their
          .fvwm2rc file I know that they are running one of the 2.xx
          versions, since they rarely mention exactly what version
          they are running.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

29) Every time I update my install, my currently running fvwm session
    dies.  Why is that?

A: Many OSes swap the program from memory via the image on the disk,
   and if you overwrite it, and then the current one tries to swap
   something back into memory before you restart, it'll core dump.  To
   avoid this, rename your old execs or move them to some other
   directory.  The 'mv' command preserves the inode so it won't
   coredump, but then when you restart fvwm it'll pick up the new
   copy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

30) Will FVWM ever support a separate colormap for each desktop?

A: Doubtful, althougth I'd like to see it too.  I believe that it'd be
   possible to change the default colormap whenever you switch desks,
   which would give programs started when that desk is active that
   colormap, how would you deal with windows being moved across desks?

   Plus fvwm itself needs certain colormap entries for all of its
   drawing (borders, menus, etc), so these colors would have to be
   pre-allocated in all of the colormaps, or something like that.

   While this all *might* be technically possible, I don't feel that
   it's really feasable right now (too much code bloat and
   complexity), especially since most color hog programs (ie Netscape)
   allow you to have them install private colormaps.

   I may explore this a little at some point in the future though.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

31) I try to run some program under FVWM, but it dies with an X11
    error like BadAccess.  The same program works just fine under MWM
    or OLWM.  What's going on?

A: The error message usually looks something like this:

        X Error of failed request:  BadAccess (attempt to access private
        resource denied)
         Major opcode of failed request:  28 (X_GrabButton)
         Serial number of failed request:  1595
         Current serial number in output stream:  1596

   Well, this is telling you that there is a conflict in key/button
   assignments.  In your .fvwm2rc you have bound some key/button that
   this program really wants to bind to an action, but it can't since
   FVWM has already done so (but you weren't doing it in the rc file
   for your previous window manager).  Figure out what the offending
   key binding is and remove it from your .fvwm2rc, or temporarily via
   FvwmTalk by removing the FVWM binding (see the man page for the Key
   & Mouse commands).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

32) I want to use FVWM, but I don't have root access on my machine.
    Can I still install and run it?

A: Oh yes.  FVWM doesn't need to be "properly" installed by root to be
   run.  All you really have to do is copy the binaries to one of your
   local directories to run it out of and make sure that the paths in
   your ~/.fvwm2rc file are correct.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

34) When will fvwm release X.Y.Z be ready?

A: This is always a difficult question to answer. We work on fvwm on
   a volunteer basis.  Things get done when we have the time.

   Joining the fvwm-workers mailing list might prove instructive.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

35) I'm a sysadmin, and if I wanted to force fvwm to read a system rc
    file and then the user's rc file, how would I do that?

A: Well, you could probably do something like this:

        - have the first line of everyone's .fvwm2rc be 'Read
          global.fvwm2rc' and have global.fvwm2rc reside in your
          defined "sysconfdir" (from the ./configure step).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

36) I'm a sysadmin, and if I wanted fvwm to look for all of it's rc
    files in a hidden directory, say ~/.fvwm, much like CDE does, how
    could I do that?

A: This could be probably done similarily to #35 above.  The system rc
   file in the "sysconfdir" could do something like:

        Read .fvwm/Init      quiet
        Read .fvwm/Decors    quiet
        Read .fvwm/Styles    quiet
        Read .fvwm/Functions quiet
        Read .fvwm/Menus     quiet
        Read .fvwm/Keys      quiet
        Read .fvwm/Modules   quiet

   or whatever breakdown you deemed appropriate, and you would have
   default versions of these in {"sysconfdir"}/.fvwm/ that it could find in
   case the user was missing one of them and you wanted to supply defaults.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

38) When having FvwmButtons swallow an app, is it possible to have
    button presses assigned to actions as well?  For instance, I'd
    like to swallow xload and have a button press pop up an xterm, or
    swallow xbiff and have a button press bring up the list of
    messages.

A: You can do this, but it's not obvious how.  The button presses
   normally get passed through to the swallowed application, but if
   you put a title on the button, you can assign actions to that.
   Here's an example that someone sent to the mailing list once:

   *FvwmButtons(1x4,       \
     Title,          'System Info' \
     Swallow,        "xload" 'Exec xload' \
     Action(Mouse 1) 'Exec xosview -cua0 -net 200 -ul -l -geometry 325x325', \
     Action(Mouse 2) 'Exec xcpustate -interval 1 -bg "#a4978e" -fg black', \
     Action(Mouse 3) 'Exec rxvt -fg "khaki" -bg "dark olive green" \
                           -fat -n top -T Top -7 -e top' )

   And you could come up with something similar for xbiff (untested):

   *FvwmButtons(1x2 \
     Title 'Check Mail' Swallow "xbiff" 'Exec xbiff' \
     Action(Mouse 1) 'Exec from | xmessage -file -' )

   plus you could bind another button (say Mouse 3) to run your
   mail program.

   Sometime in the future I'll probably try and fix it so that you can
   actually assign a button press over the app itself...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

39) I'm trying to use fvwm under CDE/COSE, but encountering
    difficulties.  Any suggestions?

A: Sure - here's one from Graeme McCaffery:

   -----
     Finally I have found out how to run fvwm properly from cde 8-))
     (thanks to Lars Sodergren).

     First set your home session in Dtwm. That usually is an empty
     session, though you could have the cde session manager remember
     what your desktop was like instead of FvwmSaveDesk etc..

     Then you have to set two resources in .Xdefaults:

       *wmStartupCommand: /home/orion/spxgm/bin/Fvwm
       *waitWmTimeout: 1

     In this case I run fvwm from a shell script so that library
     variables etc are set properly for everyone.  The waitWmTimeout
     tells the session manager how long to wait until it starts the
     window manager. I've set it to 1 second. By default it's 60 secs.

     Finally you have to quit with

       /usr/dt/bin/dtaction ExitSession (or whatever your path is for dtaction)

     Now you can happily use cde programs and fvwm.
   -----

----------------------------------------------------------------------

40) How do I capture the output (eg errors) of fvwm?

A: A couple of different ideas spring to mind:
        - XSession, which is handy for other reasons
        - FvwmTalk will show them
        - pipe the output of fvwm to something like 'notifier' when
          invoking it
        - XConsole (or xterm/rxvt -C) might catch them, depending on
          your X11 setup

41) Linux XF86 virtual screen size & fvwm interaction...

A: Turn off the Linux Virtual Screen stuff in your XF86Config file if
   you don't like it...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

42) Why do NumLock and CapsLock interfere with ClickToFocus and/or my
    mouse bindings?

A: Because they are treated as modifiers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

43) I'm seeing odd things when trying to preprocess files with the
    FvwmM4/Cpp module...

A: Yup, I imagine that you might be.  Things like the InitFunction not
   being called or windows that were running before FVWM started not
   getting their Borders & Style options set, etc.

   The reason for all this is because of the fact that FvwmM4 is a
   module.  Fvwm won't be looking at the commands comming back from
   the module until after it hits the mainloop of the code, AFTER the
   startup is all done and it's already tried to execute the
   InitFunction.

   So, some solutions I've been thinking about:

        - Create an exec or script that will invoke whatever
          preprocessor you want appropriately and run that via
          PipeRead.  All those default macros in the M4/Cpp modules
          would need to become FVWM_* env vars, defined by fvwm and
          used by the exec/script to pass them on as macros to the
          preprocessor.
        - I have a new dynamic loading module interface in mind that
          would take care of this (among many other things), but that
          won't happen for a while...
        - As a simple temporary fix, FvwmM4/Cpp could send a
          'Recapture' command back as the last thing done, plus
          optionally an 'InitFunction' call (but that should be based
          on a command line option).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

45) Is it possible to raise a window when I click into the window
    itself, not just the border?

A: Any version later than 2.0.46 (i.e. 2.1.x or later) has this
   feature. Currently it is provided through the GlobalOpts command.
   This will possibly change in the future and be made an option to
   the Style command:

     GlobalOpts MouseFocusClickRaises

----------------------------------------------------------------------

46) Menus with gradient backgrounds flicker or are very slow.

A: The flickering is caused by fvwm constantly redrawing the menus
   when a submenu pops up or down. One way to help this is to use a
   X server with backing storage (XFree86 has backing storage
   support, I don't know about other servers but I guess that any
   decent X server has it). If your Xserver is started with the
   -bs option, remove it. If not try the -wm option, for example:

     startx -- -wm

   You may have to adapt this example to your system (e.g. if you
   use xinit to start X).

   If that doesn't help, either because your X server does not have
   backing storage or because system resources are limited, make
   sure submenus do not overlap the parent menu:

     MenuStyle <stylename> PopupOffset 1 100

   Unfortunately this does not work properly with the fvwm
   menu style.

   For the speed problem both suggestions above might help too.
   Another thing to try is to turn hilighting of the active menu
   item other than by forground color off. Put these lines in your
   .fvwm2rc after the menu styles have been defined:

     MenuStyle <stylename> Hilight3DOff, HilightBackOff
     MenuStyle <Stylename> ActiveFore <preferred color>

----------------------------------------------------------------------

47) How do I get Alt-Tab behaviour like another GUI?

A: The built in command WindowList provides a very close approximation
   to the Alt-Tab feature found in another GUI.  It doesn't look the
   same but the following .fvwm2rc sample will provide a similar
   interface:
   
      Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort
   
   Hitting Alt-Tab will pop up the WindowList menu. Unlike another GUI
   you should not keep the Alt key held down, the menu will stay up
   until you hit Return/Enter or Escape.  You can change focus to a
   window on the menu by using the up and down arrow keys to move the
   menu selection and then hitting Return or Enter. Hitting Escape will
   close the menu without doing anything. The WindowList menu has hot
   keys assigned for the first 26 windows and you can use the hot key to
   go directly to the window.
   
   The menu invoked with the above line will show all windows in
   most recently focused order unless you have used the Focus
   command (see the next question). It shows each windows name and
   geometry with some extra flags to indicate Sticky, OnTop and
   iconified windows.
   
   A simpler style can be used with the following:
   
      Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c CurrentDesk NoGeometry

   This will just list the windows on the current desk (titles only).
   
   The other GUI has the feature of selecting the previous window if
   Alt-TAB is hit and released quickly. This behaviour cannot be exactly
   duplicated but similar functionality can be assigned to hitting
   Alt-TAB twice in quick succession (like a double click for keys):

      DestroyFunc my_dbltab2
      AddToFunc my_dbltab2 "I" WindowListFunc $w
      DestroyFunc my_dbltab
      AddToFunc my_dbltab "I" Prev (CurrentDesk) my_dbltab2
      Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c CurrentDesk NoGeometry my_dbltab
   
   There are a lot of options to the WindowList command to control which
   windows are listed in which order and it may not be possible to set
   conditions for the Prev command to reliably select the second item
   when double keying. The WindowList command has no parallel for
   CurrentPage, Transient, Visible, Maximised, Raised, and pattern
   matching. The Prev conditions have no parallel for OnTop, Alphabetic
   and desk sorting.  The WindowList menu respects the WindowListSkip
   style attribute whereas Prev respects the CirculateSkip and
   CirculateSkipIcon style attributes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

48) What's the difference between the Focus and FlipFocus commands?

A: Both of these commands change the keyboard focus to the target
   window. They differ only in the way they affect the internally held
   list of windows. This list is used by the Next, Prev and WindowList
   commands. The list is normally sorted in most recently focused order
   with new windows being added to the end. The FlipFocus command plucks
   the target window from the list and inserts it at the beginning, The
   Focus command rotates the list around until the target window is at
   the beginning. The behaviour of FlipFocus is also used when changing
   focus with the mouse and the automatic focus changing when using
   ClickToFocus style.
   
   If you never use the Focus command the list will remain in most
   recently focused order. If you do use the Focus command the list will
   gradually get back to most recently focused order as you use
   FlipFocus.
   
   The Focus command is very useful in conjunction with the Next and
   Prev commands. e.g.

      Key KP_Add A M Next (CurrentDesk !Iconic) Focus
      Key KP_Subtract A M Prev (CurrentDesk !Iconic) Focus

   These bindings allow you to circulate the focus around the windows on
   the current desk in both directions. If Prev FlipFocus were used the
   focus would toggle between the top two windows on the window list.
   
   If you have several windows on a desk and you want to set the
   circulation order for the Next and Prev commands you should focus on
   the windows using the mouse or FlipFocus in the order you want. Fvwm2
   will learn the order and use it for the Next and Prev commands.  If
   you subsequently use the mouse to focus or FlipFocus the order will
   be lost.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

49) Why won't the StartIconic style work with {Netscape, etc.}?

A: The application won't allow it. This has only been observed with
Netscape. When Netscape starts up, FVWM starts the main window in the
iconic state. Netscape immediately issues another MapRequest, to which
the window manager must respond by de-iconifying the window, according
to the ICCCM rules.
