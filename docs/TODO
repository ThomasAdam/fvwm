======================================================================
                       TO-DO list for fvwm 2.xx
======================================================================

Please note that not everything on this list will be done, in
particular the ones that end in '?' which are really just meant to be
'think about this and perhaps investigate'.  But they are things that
I didn't want to lose track of.  It may periodically get out of date
too...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Cleanups:

  - Reindent the code and implement coding conventions (minimal).
  - Modules should be installed with 'install-exec', rather than
    'install-data' target.  This requires putting 'exec' in the
    automake variable for the module directory; i.e. moduledir -->
    moduleexecdir?
  - Make fvwmlib a shared lib?
  - clean up code duplication (esp in modules) - more stuff in
    libfvwm.a, plus perhaps a second module lib?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Administration:

  - Copy the entries from the debian bug tracking system
    http://www.debian.org/Bugs/db/pa/lfvwm2.html

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Doc cleanups:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Old Patches:

  - Safer config file reading patch?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugfixes:

  - Rewrite VISIBLE/RAISED lags to do something comprehensible.
  - Try to decrease memory usage a little more
  - Change Motion vs Click vs DoubleClick to be calculated via a
    MotionThreshold and ClickTime:
        MotionThreshold exceeded -> Motion
        MotionThreshold not exceeded & ClickTime exceeded -> Click
        MotionThreshold not exceeded & ClickTime not exceeded -> DoubleClick
  - Make transient FvwmWinList reposition itself & pointer if popped up
    off the screen (like built in menus)
  - Maximize XTerm, change font, UnMaximize, XTerm goes to wrong window size
    (still unfixed on 28-Nov-1998)
  - Colormaps and xlock -install -mode blank (& swirl) interaction still
    isn't 100% correct?
  - System Modal dialogs bug - popup menus shouldn't be allowed??  I think
    this is ok, actually...
  - Fix FvwmDeskTopScale size calculation
  - Need to fix to work correctly under 24bit (TrueColor) displays
  - Esc during moves, etc can result in windows being "lost" off desktop
  - Should also have way to make windows off desktop be recovered easier
  - Transients of transients don't get raised correctly sometimes?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

New stuff:

  - Official themes support

  - Allow resizing to leave the x/y ratio intact?

  - Pin up menus? (aka known as tear-off menus)
  - Multi column menus? (for LONG lists)  Or scrolling menus?

  - Private colormap option for menus?

  - Access to certain window attribs from .fvwm2rc funcs, and
    simple if/else capabilities (or perhaps a module to do so)??
  - Simple static variables for .fvwm2rc functions (for toggles, etc)??

  - Make sure fvwm handles all 4 focus states from the ICCCM (I don't
    think it handles a certain one of them 100% correctly).

  - Resurrect StubbornPlacement style
  - Add StickyOnDesk <number> style, to allow stickyness on certain
    desks only, or perhaps a StaysOnDesk <num> style, to replace
    StartsOnDesk and work with the Sticky attribute, I'm not sure...
    Either way, multiple values need to be allowed
  - Need to indicate sticky icons somehow, and perhaps sticky windows
    that don't have a titlebar.  I'd like to bring back the different
    color for the sticky windows as an option, if I can do it cleanly.
    Perhaps a special Decor now?

  - Function to simulate button presses, to go with CursorMove?  Might
    not be possible since many apps ignore SYNTHETIC events...

  - Easy module name changes from .fvwm2rc (either using changes in
    module exec code & rc parser, or in modules themselves)

  - Improved FvwmPager (add/rename desktops on fly)
  - A module that just has buttons for the active desktops, like desktop
    switcher in dtwm (COSE).  Could be munged into FvwmPager.
  - See if it's possible to drop windows onto the pager ala olvwm?
    (domivogt (4-Apr-199): there has been a patch for 2.0.46, hopefully
    I can convince the author to update it.)
  - Add option to not show sticky windows in pager.  Perhaps also add
    ability to filter out windows based on name/class/resource?

  - "Captive" fvwm (ala ctwm)?

  - Allow size geometry specs for FvwmButtons & perhaps other modules
    (Pager).

  - FvwmAuto additions for AutoLower & per window config (requires keywds?)
  - Module to X Select window Name, Class, Resource, ID, etc...??
  - FvwmMsgLog module to pop up a log of fvwm error msgs?

  - Support for cut in FvwmForm text fields. (It has paste.)
  - Add simple history mechanism for FvwmForm text fields?
  - Make FvwmForm have Resource & Class values

  - Add to module communications to pass titlebar & button window ids to
    allow modules to muck with those windows (for animation, or whatever)?

  - Mouse button chording?

  - More control over icon appearance (non 3D, fg/bg colors, constant
    size, gradients, etc)?

  - Implement (or at least investigate) dynamic loading of functions
    on systems that support it?
        AIX - load
        Linux - dld (gnu) or dlopen (ELF)
        SunOS, Solaris, OSF - dlopen
        HP-UX - shl_*
    I don't know how much of a win this is over modules though.  Less
    portable.  Could be useful for changing border and menu styles or
    adding complex functions to the rc language dynamically.
      (Actually, this might be a big win for some modules, like the
      pager, autoraise, and the preprocessor modules - it would
      eliminate time delays in socket comm.  Idea - dynloaded modules
      add hook functions that module comm functions invoke.  Gives
      modules greater access to fvwm internals, although generic
      functions should be provided to actually access them.  Both
      types of modules, socket & dyn, could be supported
      simultaneously?)

  - Improve modules communications interface (collect the code, make it
    more intuitive, provide more generic interface to it, etc)

  - A WindowGravity option that controlls placement direction choices
    for SmartPlacement (and perhaps RandomPlacement)?  Perhaps make it
    a Style option??

  - Add option for Prev/Next function to 'wrap' at ends of list?

  - Add twm SqeezeTitle functionality to TitleStyle stuff & merge into
    Style command, perhaps???

  - Allow neg vals for Maximize to indicate from bottom/right of screen
  - Allow neg vals for Move to indicate from bottom/right of screen

  - Add way to set keyword/value pairs to windows (via Atoms?) as a
    way for giving extra info to modules through style commands?

  - Make GetConfigLine be more intelligent, to filter out what gets
    sent (for instance, pass module prefix to look for [ Note 2])
    and be able to ask for ImagePath, etc instead of sending those
    with all the config info, so only the modules that need it could
    ask for it.
    (Note there is some functionality in libs/Parse.c to allow this).
    Note 2:  The part about "passing module prefixes" was done during
    release 2.3.3.

  - Allow Resize to have units of "what the window resizes by"
  - Bug in:
        AddToFunc resize-and-move I resize 100 100
        + I move 100 300

  - ToggleButtonStyle (to keep pushed in)?
  - Allow bitmap/mask files to define buttons as well?
    (Better: new alternate def like hl(x1,y1,x2,y2) sh(x1,y1,x2,y2))

  - Add a WaitForExec to force waiting for the last Exec command to
    finish, or an ExecAndWait function that doesn't return until
    command is finished (perhaps call it 'System', to match the C function)

  - Make fvwm look at gravity when moving windows when reparenting, to
    change corner that gets "anchored" so windows w/ neg offsets are
    still placed correctly when bordered initially

  - Investigate internationalization issues (handling of compound
    text, messages placed in a message catalog, etc) to see if they
    should be added at some point.

  - New module combining aspects of FvwmButtons, FvwmScript, FvwmForm,
    and Wharf to make one super module?  (FvwmGUI or something like that?)

  - Investigate reporting file, and line number when issuing error messages.
    Note that some commands are generated by modules, on pipes and in
    these cases it could be a little tricky figuring out where the command
    came from, and it doesn't really have a line number.

Bob Woodside's To-Do's
----------------------

  - merge (well, probably re-implement) my 2.0.46 patch to cause icon
    positions to be remembered across a Restart
