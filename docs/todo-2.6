  C.5 Gtk+-2 and window placement [#938,2.4,2002-10-18]

  C.8 An afterimage remains when moving a window [#913,2.4,2002-08-09].
      Not a bug?

  C.9 Moving operation delayed together with XFree86 4.2.0 xtt module
      [#903,2002-07-07] Not an fvwm bug?
      [Olivier: Cannot reproduce this]

  C.15 Right mouse-click turn screen to black with xmgrace [#792,2.4,2001-10-10]
       Not a fvwm Bug?
       [Olivier: unable to reproduce this problem with grace-5.1.12 and
       2.5.8 or 2.4.16]

  C.16 Redraw problem with netscape [#791,2.4,2001-10-10]. Not a fvwm Bug?

  C.19 fvwm 2.4.0 on HP-UX breaks xterm etc. [#767,2.4,2001-08-23]
       [dv: I can't imagine how fvwm would be involved, but do not have an
       HP-UX machine to test this]

  C.20 Erratic EdgeScroll behavior [#766,2.4,2001-08-21]. Fixed?

  C.23 Strange behavior with XForms "sliderall" demo [#758,2.4,2001-08-12].

       [dv: Definitely not fixed.  Nobody did anything about it.]

  C.27 The "titles" sometimes aren't shown when no items are available in a
       FvwmIconMan
       [Olivier: unable to reproduce this]

D. To be discussed
------------------

  D.2 Leave or remove the current change to triggering bindings on button press
      or release?  Seems to irritate a lot of users, but fixes a root window
      binding bug.
      [dv: added on 29-Mar-2003]

  D.3 Added the possibility "to grab fast and execute even if the grab fail"
      when executing a complex function.
      [Olivier: added on 2003-08-09]

E. To do
--------

  E.3 After F.1 try to find translator
      [Olivier, this can be done after 2.6.0 is released]

  E.6 Rename FvwmProxy
      [dv: added on 02-Mar-2003]

  E.7 Fix the FvwmProxy placement algorithm (it may loop and can place windows
      off screen)
      [dv: added on 02-Mar-2003]

  E.11 Perl library: finalize API.
       [Mikhael]

  E.12 Perl Library: add event trackers.
       [Mikhael]

  E.15 Complete FvwmWindowMenu to be more functional.
       [Mikhael (with help of Richard Lister?)]

  E.16 Rename all "Pixmap" in the syntax to "Image" while supporting both.
       Rename MultiPixmap to MultiPart, since it also accepts Solid and
       Colorset options, not just images for different titlebar parts.
       [Mikhael]
       [dv: I wouldn't do that anymore.  That syntax will be removed soon after
       the 2.6 release, so the clean up work is in vain.]

F. Distribution issues
----------------------

  F.1 Update the default config files, probably needs discussion...

  F.2 Update/complete fvwm-convert-2.6

  F.3 Check INSTALL.fvwm


G. Testing
----------

  G.1 Update and run the purify script again
      [Olivier: mostly done with valgrind. Should be done again]

  G.2 Test fvwm with GNOME2 and KDE3 [see in particular: #980]
      [Olivier: seems to work not so bad]

  G.5 Is PositiveWrite module locking problem fixed? [e.g., #708]


---- Closed recently ----------------------------------------------------------

  E.17 Finally document the Repeat command.  Forgot that for years :-)
       [dv: added on 30-Apr-2003]
       [dv: closed on 3-Feb-2004]

  E.18 Documented IconTitle / NoIconTitle, StartIconic / StartNormal,
       WindowListSkip / WindowListHit, CirculateSkip / CirculateHit,
       CirculateSkipShaded / CirculateHitShaded, CirculateSkipIcon /
       CirculateHitIcon, StickyAcrossPagesIcon / SickyAcrossDesksIcon
       styles.
       [Olivier: added on 2003-09-04]
       [dv: closed on 3-Feb-2004]

       in FvwmScript
       [malu: added on 17-Jan-2004]
       [malu: done on 04-Feb-2004]

---- Postponed until after 2.6 ------------------------------------------------
