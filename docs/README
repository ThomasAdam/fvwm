This directory contains some of the fvwm2 documentation, including the
web pages that normally reside at the fvwm hosting site.

Unless you don't  have internet access, there  is no reason to install
these files at your site.

In this directory is the shell, txt2html.sh.  This is normally run
to take text files from the fvwm source distribution and turn them
into HTML.

Also   in  this directory is  the   shell run_man2html.sh.  This shell
invokes man2html which must be  separately installed.  (Special  fvwm2
sytle headers and colors are generated by the shell.)

As   a  release  is  shipped,  txt2html.sh   and run_man2html.sh would
normally be run in the directory where the resulting html is wanted.

This shell would be run for the files, NEWS, TODO, and FAQ.

This is  a description  of the  files  in this directory,  showing the
heirarchical structure of the web  pages.  Cross-reference type  links
from one page to another are not shown.
