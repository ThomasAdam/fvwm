This directory contains some of the fvwm2 documentation, including the
web pages that normally reside at the fvwm hosting site.

Unless you don't  have internet access, there  is no reason to install
these files at your site.

In this directory is the shell, txt2html.ksh.  This is normally run
to take text files from the fvwm source distribution and turn them
into HTML.

As a release is shipped, this would normally be run in the directory
where the resulting html is wanted.

This shell would be run for the files, NEWS, TODO, and FAQ.

This is  a description  of the  files  in this directory,  showing the
heirarchical structure of the web  pages.  Cross-reference type  links
from one page to another are not shown.
