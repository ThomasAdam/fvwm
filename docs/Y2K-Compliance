Question: Is fvwm1/fvwm2 (version ...) year 2000 compliant?

Answer: Perhaps. Fvwm is a free software project. It is given away without
charge and without any warranty. Everybody is invited to obtain the sources and
check the code for year 2000 compliance (see our web page how to get the latest
sources). We won't make any promises.
