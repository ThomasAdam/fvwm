 21) Fix the bug with eterm and transparent background (I think rxvt has
     the same problem.
     [Eterm bug fixed, rxvt doesn't work very well with transparent

 22) Investigate bug #290. (windows cannot be raised over others sometimes).

     if my suggestion helped; Dominik]
 48) Finish Windoze 95 like config file.
 49) Implement a 'H'old trigger for complex functions.

     [Mikhael: DeskTopSize is in fact honored since 2.3.12]
 59) Get Raise/Lower of transients straight.
     [duplicate of item 54]
 60) Make MaxWindowSize a style (don't release a command that will
     change anyway).
 61) Get SidecPics working again.
 62) Write a new announcement.
 63) Fix stacking order in pager.
 64) Install the new web pages.

 68) Investigate 'Xlib: sequence lost' message.
     [went away with a newer snapshot]
 69) Fix window moving. Several people have reported that moving windows
     is slow or the windows don't follow the pointer well. This is really
     a big problem.
 70) Fix resize. On one hand it's not nice that you can drag the window
     border off screen, on the other hand it doesn't hurt if the shadow
     of the border is not on screen.
 71) Fix drawing of window titles.
 72) Finish implementing colour sets for modules.
     [item split up]

 83) Fix FvwmIconMan crashes introduced by colour set support(?)
     [doesn't happen anymore]
 84) Implement colour sets in FvwmBacker.
 85) Add 'geometry' panel option in FvwmButtons.
     I think it's not worth the effort because it's similarly
     complicated as the menu position hints if I want to do it right.
     I can't see an easy solution that does something useful fast.
     [future enhancement]
 86) Finish code for setting backgrounds of other applications with
     colour sets.
 87) Describe what to do for colour set support in the module docs.

 98) Allow using colours from colour sets in fvwm commands.
 99) Make HilightColors command colour set aware.

     in finishing the patch.
     [leave it in, started to rewrite patch in a better way]
101) Finish current work on style changes w/o recapture in a
     consistent way. This doesn't necessarily mean that the
     feature has to be complete before 2.4.
102) Patch 'UseDecor' and 'UseStyle' styles and various ...Style
     commands to apply without a recapture.
     [finished except UseStyle]
103) Add recent bug reports to to-do list.
104) Fix FvwmCommandS core dumps on X server shutdown.
105) Test binding code.
106) Test window position code.
     [skipped, code has been around for 2 years without problems]
107) "Recapture" while an icon is focused takes several seconds.
     [reported by Mikhael; confirmed by Dominik]
     [workaround implemented]
108) FvwmPager desk separators are not updated if their colour set

       shade-iconify-move_to_other_page-deiconify-unshade
     (and equivalent bug with maximize instead of shade).
113) FvwmForm sets no class/resource.
114) FvwmIdent sets no class/resource.
115) FvwmWharf sets no class/resource.
118) Investigate "FvwmPager & StaysOnTop" bug (#543).
     [reported by Nadim Shaikli <nadim.shaikli@intel.com>]
     [no response, consider this fixed]
119) MaxSwallow does not work in FvwmWharf e.g. with
     'xload -g 50x50'.
     [reported by Dominik]
     [not reproducible anymore]
120) Icons are not always sorted properly; there may be
     gaps after page switching (with IconBox).
121) Investigate FvwmPager core dump.
     [reported by Wing Tung Leung <tg@skynet.be> on 20-Feb-2000]
     [Dominik: Didn't get any reply, stack trace, ...]
     [unreproducible]
123) Bug #378 (FvwmPager interferes with xscreensaver)
     [unreproducible, seems to be fixed]
124) Bug #477 (closing xbuffy popup window nukes focus)
127) Bug #511 (xpp subwindows not drawn properly)
     [not a bug, xpp is broken]

     the focused window).
     [either an enhancement request or not in the scope of fvwm]
131) Sticky windows move to the top in the pager view if the desk is
     changed.
132) Tru64 sizeof(unsigned long) problem
133) Bug #602 (window placement w/ 2.3.15)
135) FvwmWinList doesn't handle negative geometries properly
     with TitleAtBottom.
136) Implement a FlushUpdates command to apply style changes
     within a function?
     [nope; enhanced Refresh/RefreshWindow instead]
137) Bug #550 (FvwmAuto raises after 'lower')
138) Bug #593 (key bindings w/ Motif)
139) Fix TaskBar tips drawing.
     [reported by gregory@mcst.ru (Gregory A. Shimansky) on
     14-Apr-2000]
140) Remove "Layer" command?  Instead, the "Layer" styles
     can be applied immediately w/o Recapture.
     [3 votes against vs 1 vote for removing]
     [maybe after 2.4]
141) Remove "MoveSmoothness" command?  I wrote it back when
     window motion was very jerky due to excessive network
     traffic, but I guess it's not very useful.
142) Remove copyright disclaimers from individual files
     (smaller tarball).
     [saves only 15k tarball size; not worth the effort]
144) Bug #604 (ActivePlacements doesn't work if FvwmAnimate
     is running).

179) Fix module communication between FvwmConsole and
     FvwmConsoleC.
