Question: Is fvwm1/fvwm2 (version ...) year 2000 compliant?

Answer 1 (very short): No.

Answer 2 (slightly longer): We don't care.

Answer 3 (not so short): We all have a personal opinion on this topic, but we
won't tell.

Answer 4 (long): Fvwm is a free software project. It is given away without
charge and without any warranty. Everybody is invited to obtain the sources and
check the code for year 2000 compliance (see our web page how to get the latest
sources). If this question is so important to you, why don't you set your clock
to a date ten years in the future and try yourself?
